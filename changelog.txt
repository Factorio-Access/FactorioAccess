Version: 0.15.0
Date: 2024.10.19

  Summary:
    - The main highlight of this update is a full rewrite of the software of the scanner tool. 
      It now incrementally scans in the background, which makes scan refreshes significantly faster, 
      especially on larger maps. It also has smarter ways of grouping objects.

    - IMPORTANT: If you upgrade into an existing save, the new scanner tool will need to set up 
      for the first time. This will take around 1 minute before it starts returning results. 
      This does not happen on newly created maps or on maps where the setup has already been done before. 
      However, this might happen again after future updates that signficantly modify the new scanner tool.

Version: 0.13.1

Version: 0.13.0
Date: 2024.08.11

  Summary:
    - This update introduces a prototype for audio rulers and greatly improves Kruise Kontrol 
      functionality thanks to our transition to Kruise Kontrol Remote, a fork created by our 
      developer @ahicks92. It also remaps some keys and improves nudging. There are other small 
      changes such as better ghost mining and better entity selection and some tutorial corrections 
      by @danielw97.

    - Note that Factorio Access is from now optionally dependent on Kruise Kontrol Remote while it 
      is no longer compatible with other versions of Kruise Kontrol, which players need to disable 
      or delete. Otherwise Factorio Access will not run.  This only applies if you are upgrading.
      New installs don't need to worry about it.

Version: 0.11.1
Date: 2024.05.13

  Summary:
    - This update features the second phase of the refactoring of the codebase into modules, 
      making it easier to follow and maintain. It is also accompanied by some small additions, 
      changes, and bugfixes. Improved systems include the launcher, Remote View, Kruise Kontrol, 
      fast travel, and the rail builder. While a fair amount of testing has been done, new bugs may 
      still emerge due to the refactor.

Version: 0.11.0
Date: 2024.04.27

  Summary:
    - This update is mostly about changes under the hood while the mod codebase is being refactored 
      so that the code is easier to follow and maintain, for contributors both new and old. 
      The update also includes some bug fixes and small improvements, but the refactor has caused 
      new bugs. Extensive testing is needed to find and fix the new bugs. Therefore this release is 
      labeled as "experimental" and is recommended only to players who are interested in bug hunting.

  Summary:
    - This update comes after some restructuring of the mod repository and joining the official 
      Factorio Mod Portal. Note that releases still need to be installed from the GitHub page 
      because of the launcher and config changes required to run the mod properly. 
      The update itself includes tweaks, additions, and bugfixes across the board thanks to 
      community feedback. Notably, several blueprint bugs have been fixed and Remote View has been added.
