messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg1=This is a blueprint book, a collection of multiple blueprints.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg2=Getting blueprints into this book is not done through these menus.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg3=To get blueprints into the book, put this book in your inventory and the blueprint in your hand. Then ctrl shift click on its slot.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg4=This menu consists of quick management commands for all blueprints in the book.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg5=Clicking the name of a blueprint sets it as the active blueprint.  The active blueprint is the blueprint that will be built if you build in the world.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg6=You can drag blueprints to reorder them.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg7=In the world, m, comma, and dot can be used to interact with this book without opening this UI.
messagelist--blueprint-book-help--msg8=m and dot cycle through the blueprints in the book, and comma tells you which one is active.

messagelist--category-rows-help--msg1=This UI consists of some categories as stacked rows.
messagelist--category-rows-help--msg2=Moving up and down changes the category.
messagelist--category-rows-help--msg3=Moving left and right moves through the items in a category.
messagelist--category-rows-help--msg4=Unlike other menus, your position in each category is remembered separately.

messagelist--ch1--msg1=Welcome to the Factorio Access tutorial.  Before we get started, this chapter tells you a bit about what Factorio is, explains how to use the tutorial interface, and runs through a few basic checks.  To navigate through tutorial messages, press w and s.
messagelist--ch1--msg2=To get back here, use alt t.
messagelist--ch1--msg3=To close the tutorial interface, press e. This puts you back in whatever UI you were in, and remembers your place for next time.
messagelist--ch1--msg4=e opens your main menu if nothing else was open. If you hit e while the tutorial is closed, you will end up there. To get out of it again, press e a second time.
messagelist--ch1--msg5=Most of the time, pressing e closes all open UI.  The tutorial UI is a special case.  Instead, e closes just the tutorial. This lets you read the tutorial while other menus are open without losing your place.
messagelist--ch1--msg6=Before you go further, it is important that we confirm that you have not enabled space age. If you have, you will need to recreate your save.
messagelist--ch1--msg7=If you did not purchase space age, this does not apply to you.
messagelist--ch1--msg8=If you did, please exit the game, go into the launcher's mod menu, and disable quality, elevated rails, and space age.
messagelist--ch1--msg9=It is also advantageous to enable peaceful mode. This means that you have as much time as you want before enemies attack.  You may wish to do that now as well, but that means remaking your save.
messagelist--ch1--msg10=To do so, customize your save in the launcher's menu, go to enemies, and toggle it.  The Compass valley preset does this for you if you are using it.
messagelist--ch1--msg11=The tutorial consists of chapters.  You move between chapters with control tab.  We call these tabs.
messagelist--ch1--msg12=Each chapter has 2 subtabs.  You move between these with tab by itself.  They are the chapter's text and some example blueprints.  We will talk more about blueprints in a little while.
messagelist--ch1--msg13=Game UIs are organized the same exact way.
messagelist--ch1--msg14=Now that you know how to use the tutorial, we can talk about the game.
messagelist--ch1--msg15=Factorio is a game about building a factory.  Your goal is to build up a base which can launch a rocket.
messagelist--ch1--msg16=To do this, you need to build labs, and then put science packs in them to conduct research.
messagelist--ch1--msg17=There are 7 kinds of science pack.  The first one you will encounter is automation science.  As the game progresses, you unlock more and have to get them all to the same place at the same time.  This is the main driving mechanic of Factorio.
messagelist--ch1--msg18=Roughly, each science pack doubles the complexity of the game.  Getting through the first few is pretty easy, enough so that you can do it without building a factory if you're patient, but the last ones are a real challenge.
messagelist--ch1--msg19=If you are ever lost, one way of figuring out what to do next is to see which of your technologies are the most expensive, or if you can research a new science pack.
messagelist--ch1--msg20=Once you have researched most of the technologies in the game, you craft and launch a rocket.
messagelist--ch1--msg21=Maybe that sounds easy.  But it's not.  And on top of all of that, you've got various kinds of enemies that really don't want you to be around!  If you aren't in peaceful mode, you also have to fight back.
messagelist--ch1--msg22=Normally, you would get a very involved graphical tutorial and a lot of hints showing you how Wube wants you to play Factorio.  But we can't do that, so here is a brief explanation of how to think about it.
messagelist--ch1--msg23=Factorio is a game about solving problems nested in other problems.
messagelist--ch1--msg24=First, you learn how the basic pieces work.
messagelist--ch1--msg25=then, you put the basic pieces together into small things, around 10 by 10 in size.  These use conveyor belts (called transport belts by the game) and inserters (robot hands) to make one kind of thing.
messagelist--ch1--msg26=You then use those to make bigger pieces that put a few things together into a larger product.
messagelist--ch1--msg27=As this continues, it becomes harder and harder to get everything into the same place or to move stuff around, so your scope continues to widen, and you unlock more tools to connect things over longer distances.
messagelist--ch1--msg28=At the end of the game, science packs need to travel hundreds of tiles, and take hundreds of tiles to build as well.
messagelist--ch1--msg29=The map is infinite for all practical purposes, and endgame bases are often hundreds of tiles on a side.
messagelist--ch1--msg30=This has a few implications as to what makes a successful Factorio player, especially if you are blind.
messagelist--ch1--msg31=Being organized is very important.  Working out repeating patterns that are easy to put together is also very important.  These tutorials will help you with learning some repeating patterns later.
messagelist--ch1--msg32=The trick to doing really well is that if you are organized, you don't need to remember where you put hundreds of things.  Just that over here we make automation science, and that you solved it with a solution shaped like this.
messagelist--ch1--msg33=When you go back to it, because you solved the problems on a small scale the same way, you can look at it and get it back into your head much more easily.
messagelist--ch1--msg34=One of the things that makes Factorio a great game is that sighted players play the same way.  The game even has systems to let you save and quickly place down groups of buildings, called blueprints.  There is even a clipboard.
messagelist--ch1--msg35=The reward isn't "look at how I placed 1000 things that work", though you can play it that way.  Instead, it's "look how I elegantly solved the problem Factorio confronted me with, and integrated it into the rest of my stuff".
messagelist--ch1--msg36=Usually, a sighted player will start by being haphazard for their first run, throwing whatever they need at the time wherever.  Then, they learn to be more and more organized.  The only real difference is that as a blind player, being organized to start makes the game much easier.  The really painful place for us is organically discovering that this is required, which is why this tutorial spends so long explaining how Factorio wants you to play it.  Most sighted players fumble through for a while, because to them being disorganized is just a minor inconvenience.
messagelist--ch1--msg37=As you get better at the game, your designs will tend to use more repeating patterns, but those repeating patterns will become complicated, and they will nest in larger things.
messagelist--ch1--msg38=Now, it is time to move on to doing stuff for real.  Press control tab to move to the first real chapter, and we can get started on building our first lab.
messagelist--ch1--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyttBRykvMTVWyUkrOMFSqBQBm1weW

messagelist--ch10--msg1=It is now time to automate science.  This chapter introduces only one new feature, then you can get to the building.
messagelist--ch10--msg2=The new feature is very simple, often referred to as larger cursors. Shift i zooms out, increasing the size of your cursor, and control i makes it smaller.
messagelist--ch10--msg3=When your cursor is zoomed out, you get a summary of what is in the area, and your cursor moves by the larger size.  For example, at size 3, each move is by 3 tiles, and you are getting a summary of the 3x3 area centered at your cursor's position.
messagelist--ch10--msg4=This is important for a bunch of reasons, but for this chapter the point of it is to find somewhere to build.
messagelist--ch10--msg5=Control shift i toggles combat mode.  If you turn combat mode on, the cursor will stop working and a bunch of controls change meaning.  If you press it by accident, press it again to get out.
messagelist--ch10--msg6=Anyway, let's get to it.  Start by finding some empty space to build. Rocks and trees are fine, but cliffs and resource patches are not.  You can't build over cliffs, and if you build over resource patches you have to take it down later to put drills there instead.
messagelist--ch10--msg7=The recipe for automation science packs is one copper plate and one iron gear wheel, and the recipe for an iron gear wheel is 2 iron plates.
messagelist--ch10--msg8=That means an automation science pack needs 2 iron plates and 1 copper plate.  To craft 100, you need  200 iron plates and 100 copper plates, etc.
messagelist--ch10--msg9=You can now craft an assembling machine 1, as long as you have completed the automation research.  Please make 2 of these, 2 inserters, and 2 electric poles.  Remember, 2 electric poles is only one craft.
messagelist--ch10--msg10=Assembling machines are crafting machines, along with many other buildings in Factorio.  Earlier, we showed you that the crafting menu lets you get information on what can craft an item by pressing k.
messagelist--ch10--msg11=Assembling machines can craft anything which the crafting menu says they can craft.
messagelist--ch10--msg12=Slightly later on, you will unlock recipes which cannot be crafted by hand, and must be made in a machine, just like how smelting must happen in a furnace.  You will also unlock recipes which require better or sometimes even specific machines.
messagelist--ch10--msg13=The other difference between machines is how fast they craft.  An assembling machine 1 crafts half as fast as you.  You can see this after placement by right clicking the machine on the map.
messagelist--ch10--msg14=You now need to get power poles to the empty area you chose.  Since you are now working with more than one, it's worth knowing that pressing n tells you which other poles are connected to it.  As a reminder, build lock places poles at the maximum distance, and they automatically connect to all other poles in range when placed.
messagelist--ch10--msg15=Just like inserters can move things to and from belts, they can move things between machines.  Players call this kind of design direct insertion.  We will work west to east.
messagelist--ch10--msg16=Note that as usual, a blueprint for a working copy of this setup is attached.
messagelist--ch10--msg17=First, place an assembling machine.  It is 3 by 3.  Then, count 4 tiles right and place a second.
messagelist--ch10--msg18=This is a perfect row, but there is a 1 tile gap between them.  In that gap, you can place an inserter and a power pole.
messagelist--ch10--msg19=The pole powers both machines and the inserter.
messagelist--ch10--msg20=Next, we do the same thing: move 4 tiles to the right of the northwest corner of the second machine.  Then, we place our lab, also 3 by 3.
messagelist--ch10--msg21=And just like we did before, an inserter and small pole goes into the gap.
messagelist--ch10--msg22=Next, you need to get a line of poles to within 7 tiles of one of the poles in this setup.  That will connect it to your electrical network.
messagelist--ch10--msg23=Finally, it is time to turn it on.
messagelist--ch10--msg24=Clicking an assembling machine which is not configured opens directly to the recipe selector, which works exactly like your crafting menu.  This includes searching, which works in all mod UIs.  Click the first machine and set it to iron gear wheel, then click the second and set it to automation science pack.
messagelist--ch10--msg25=Next up, you can smart insert into them with control click.  Smart insert a bunch of iron plates into the iron gear wheel assembler, and then smart insert a bunch of copper plates into the automation science pack assembler.
messagelist--ch10--msg26=After they are configured, they have inventories.  If you click again, you can see their inventories as the first tab, and change the recipe by hitting control tab to get to the building configuration.
messagelist--ch10--msg27=Note that this can take a few hundred ms, so if you go super fast you might not see the inventories yet.
messagelist--ch10--msg28=The first inventory is the inputs, and the mod will tell you what it can accept.  Once configured, assembling machines only take the items they need for the current recipe.
messagelist--ch10--msg29=Now, select some technologies and research them.  This setup will produce an automation science pack once every 10 seconds (the recipe is 5 seconds, but the machine is 2 times slower), so technologies will take at minimum 10 seconds times their science pack requirement.
messagelist--ch10--msg30=The iron gear wheel machine often says output full.  This is expected.  It happens because the iron gear wheel recipe takes only 0.5 seconds (1 second in the machine, since it is 2 times slower than you are).  That means that this one gear assembler can satisfy up to 10 automation assemblers.
messagelist--ch10--msg31=It's not worth making use of that now.  Early game, technology is cheap enough that you might as well wait until you have the basics unlocked.
messagelist--ch10--msg32=To continue on, you should spend some time playing around.  At this point, you can unlock everything that only needs automation science packs, though slowly.
messagelist--ch10--msg33=The two most important technologies, and the ones you need for this tutorial, are logistics and electric mining drill.  You should do both of those as soon as possible, then come back for the next chapter.
messagelist--ch10--msg34=While you are waiting, you have a few options.
messagelist--ch10--msg35=First, you can set up more drills and furnaces on ore patches.  That will get you more plates.  This setup will consume plates extremely quickly, and you probably didn't have enough.  Remember that copy/paste exists.  You can copy a single furnace-drill setup a bunch of times, then copy the larger square, and so on.
messagelist--ch10--msg36=Second, you could build more copies of this lab-assembler setup, and use them to complete research faster.  That assumes that you have enough plates.
messagelist--ch10--msg37=Third, if you right click an electric pole you will see that the pole says you are almost using all the electricity you can produce.  If you place a second boiler next to your first facing the same direction, it will receive water from the first one. In this way, you can scale power.
messagelist--ch10--msg38=We have also attached a blueprint for power to this chapter.  It consists of 2 boilers, 4 steam engines, and 2 electric poles.
messagelist--ch10--msg39=If you take it and feed it water on either side, both boilers get water (because boilers pass water through to each other) and all 4 steam engines are covered by a pole.
messagelist--ch10--msg40=A slight modification to this blueprint can make it tileable.  If your synthesizer is butchering that, it's tile-able.  A tileable blueprint is one where you can put copies next to each other and they will all connect without you doing anything.
messagelist--ch10--msg41=You have sort of seen this before.  The transport belt copy/paste pattern and the drill+furnace combination are all tileable, though they don't really interact with each other.
messagelist--ch10--msg42=At this point in the game you really only need 2 steam engines, but being slightly less efficient lets us hand you an optimal setup for later.
messagelist--ch10--msg43=Now that you are scaling, it is worth mentioning that one offshore pump can satisfy 200 boilers, and each boiler can satisfy 2 steam engines.  Because steam engines can connect to each other, this often ends up looking like a tower made of a boiler and two steam engines, repeated a bunch of times.
messagelist--ch10--msg44=The problem is, though, that every steam engine needs to be in the supply range of a pole to contribute.  Since they are 3 wide poles can connect to each other over two of them, but a pole on one side of a steam engine can't reach far enough to cover one adjacent to it.
messagelist--ch10--msg45=For that reason, you have to leave some gaps every so often to get poles in the right place.
messagelist--ch10--msg46=Look at the blueprint and this will probably make a lot more sense.  But on the flip side this is a tutorial, not a walkthrough, and discovering these setups for yourself is a large part of the game.  So we won't spend more time explaining it.
messagelist--ch10--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyMdNRykvMTVWyUkrOMDRQqgUAbk8HxQ==

messagelist--ch2--msg1=Now that you have some idea of the game, it is time to talk about your initial goals and what you must do to achieve them.
messagelist--ch2--msg2=This is how you think about Factorio.  You find your goal, then you work backward from it until you get to something you can do.
messagelist--ch2--msg3=Research in Factorio is done in labs.  Labs need power.  Power needs steam engines and boilers.  Steam engines and boilers need all of the basic resources.
messagelist--ch2--msg4=The mod offers a number of features to navigate the world.  The first of these is the scanner.  The scanner takes the map and turns it into a list of features.
messagelist--ch2--msg5=The simplest use of the scanner is to find rocks.  Rocks, when mined, contain stone.  Some also contain coal.
messagelist--ch2--msg6=To scan, press end.  This will refresh the list of things that the scanner shows you, and sort them by distance from your character.
messagelist--ch2--msg7=To move between things in the scanner list, press page up and page down.
messagelist--ch2--msg8=The mod offers a few ways of moving around.  The first we will teach you is Kruise Kontrol.
messagelist--ch2--msg9=Since Factorio is a building game, we integrated a second mod which automates a variety of tasks that aren't critical to gameplay.  Kruise Kontrol, often referred to as KK, is a mod by one of the Factorio developers which can do some simple tasks.
messagelist--ch2--msg10=In this case, we can use it to mine rocks without having to find them one by one.  Please read a bit further before trying to use it, as you will not be able to read this tutorial at the same time.
messagelist--ch2--msg11=To start KK, you press control alt right bracket with the cursor on an item.  We will talk about the cursor more in a little while, but for now what you need to know is that it is moved by the scanner.
messagelist--ch2--msg12=To stop KK, you press enter while it is doing something.
messagelist--ch2--msg13=The mod still continues to function while KK runs, but using it can interrupt what KK is trying to do, so it is generally best to leave it alone.
messagelist--ch2--msg14=Now, press end, then use page up and page down to find a rock.  Once you have, press control alt right bracket.  After your character has mined a few rocks, press enter to stop KK.
messagelist--ch2--msg15=Your character has now mined stone.  If you were lucky, your character also mined coal.
messagelist--ch2--msg16=To find out if it did or not, open the inventory with e. Please note that e also closes this tutorial. You can get back to it with control alt slash once you have opened the inventory, and close it out with e.
messagelist--ch2--msg17=E serves two functions.  If no UI is open, it opens one. Otherwise, it closes one.
messagelist--ch2--msg18=The inventory is a grid, navigated with w, a, s, and d.  in the mod, w, a, s, d are arranged like and used as arrow keys.  We usually spell it wasd.
messagelist--ch2--msg19=Inventories are presented as 10-by-x grids, where the last row is truncated if the number of slots is not a multiple of 10.
messagelist--ch2--msg20=They sort so that all items are at the beginning.
messagelist--ch2--msg21=It is awkward to navigate it in this form, which is why we also support search functionality.  That is what you will use here.
messagelist--ch2--msg22=With the inventory open, press control f, type coal, and press enter.  This sets the search pattern, but does not yet move you to it.
messagelist--ch2--msg23=To cycle through search results, press shift enter for next and control enter for previous.
messagelist--ch2--msg24=These controls are odd for technical reasons.  To remember it, shift is next because shift is above control.
messagelist--ch2--msg25=It is good to note that search results update without you doing anything.  You don't need to worry about that now, but once you start crafting you don't need to repeatedly press control f to find out if something showed up, just keep using shift enter.
messagelist--ch2--msg26=If you get no search results for coal, you have not found any yet.  You have two choices.  The first choice is to mine some more rocks.  The second choice is to continue to the next chapter, where we will discuss mining from resource patches.
messagelist--ch2--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyMtNRykvMTVWyUkrOMFKqBQBmrAeU

messagelist--ch3--msg1=Now that we have what we need to bootstrap our base, we can begin to build for real.  But before we do that, it is time to talk about a few more mod features.
messagelist--ch3--msg2=the mod has a concept of a virtual cursor, just called the cursor.  When all UIs are closed, wasd moves the cursor around.
messagelist--ch3--msg3=The cursor is your hand in the world, the blind equivalent to a mouse.  It can be used to examine things and take actions.
messagelist--ch3--msg4=Your character also has a body, usually just called the character.  This is where your physical presence is.
messagelist--ch3--msg5=To build, your character must be within 10 tiles of the cursor.
messagelist--ch3--msg6=Doing that means that you need to walk around.  You have three options.
messagelist--ch3--msg7=The first, and easiest, is to use Kruise Kontrol.  Just like you did in the last chapter, you can invoke KK.  If you do so on an empty tile or resource patch, KK will walk you there provided that there is a path to do so.
messagelist--ch3--msg8=If you did it on a resource patch, it's going to start mining after it gets there.  You can just cancel it with enter once it arrives.
messagelist--ch3--msg9=The next option is to use alt+k.  Alt+k announces how far the cursor is from your character.
messagelist--ch3--msg10=The arrow keys can be used to walk around, and alt+k can be used to know where you are going.
messagelist--ch3--msg11=This is awkward for two reasons.
messagelist--ch3--msg12=The first is that you need to press i. I controls whether or not the cursor follows the character while it walks.  If the cursor is anchored to your character, then moving moves the cursor, which defeats the purpose.
messagelist--ch3--msg13=In new saves the cursor starts unanchored, and this is what you normally want.  Depending on user feedback, we may even remove this feature.
messagelist--ch3--msg14=The second problem is that the arrow keys do not do pathfinding. For now, you can walk because your character is able to slide up against trees and rocks, but once you build your first buildings you will have issues.
messagelist--ch3--msg15=The third movement option is teleporting.  This is by far the easiest, and also a cheat.  The community is split on how much of a cheat it is.  On the one hand, teleporting instantly moves your character.  But on the other, Factorio is a game about building, not exploring, and you are already slower than sighted players.
messagelist--ch3--msg16=To teleport put your cursor where you want to go and press shift t.
messagelist--ch3--msg17=The one non-cheat use of teleportation which is very important is that it can be used to get your character positioned perfectly on a specific tile.  We will discuss that more later, but very short distance teleports are a commonly done thing for various reasons.  The one which may concern you now is that this can be used to get your character out of the way of building.
messagelist--ch3--msg18=Finally, you may return the cursor to the character at any time.  To do so, press j.
messagelist--ch3--msg19=You are probably wondering where this is going.  The answer is to the coal patch.  If you explored your inventory, you noticed that you have a burner mining drill. It is time to turn it on.
messagelist--ch3--msg20=Every map has a starting area, around the coordinates 0, 0.  To get your coordinates press k.  Starting areas are guaranteed to contain iron, copper, coal, stone, and water within a hundred tiles or so.
messagelist--ch3--msg21=You can move your cursor to specific coordinates. To do so, press shift c, type two numbers separated by space, and hit enter.
messagelist--ch3--msg22=Now is a good time to note that negative y is north in Factorio.  Though this is confusing, it is not something we can change.
messagelist--ch3--msg23=The crash site is also around the coordinates 0, 0.  We will talk about that more later--for the most part, it's decorative.
messagelist--ch3--msg24=It is time to find your coal patch.  The world has thousands of things in it by the end, and even right now the scanner is very spammy.
messagelist--ch3--msg25=You can deal with this by changing the scanner category.  To do so, press control page up and control page down.
messagelist--ch3--msg26=The list of scanner categories changes based on whether or not a category has something in it right now.
messagelist--ch3--msg27=Cycle to the resources category, then use page up and down to find your coal patch.
messagelist--ch3--msg28=You will now also want to explore some with your cursor, so it is a good time to note that the scanner remembers what you are on. Pressing home will move your cursor back to the scanner's  current item.
messagelist--ch3--msg29=When you found the coal patch, your cursor was moved to the middle of it.  The mod will say something like "coal x 1234".  Coal is the resource, and the number is how much of it is still available on this tile.
messagelist--ch3--msg30=The number is called the richness.  Resource patches are the richest near their centers, and become less rich as you move toward the edge.
messagelist--ch3--msg31=The scanner also tracks overall use of patches, so that you can remotely monitor how much is left.  Please note that this is known to break after some mod updates or when the mod is added to an existing save.  This is because it is a heuristic which relies on seeing the patches before any mining happened.
messagelist--ch3--msg32=in any case, use Kruise Kontrol to walk to the coal.
messagelist--ch3--msg33=At the end of the last chapter, we said that there is a way to get coal without using stone.  That way is by hand mining the resource patch.
messagelist--ch3--msg34=Factorio mining includes getting resources, chopping down trees, and deconstructing buildings you already placed.  These all use the controls we will now describe.
messagelist--ch3--msg35=Kruise Kontrol will try to mine the coal for you, but you need to learn the manual controls.  To mine manually, put the cursor on something mineable which is within 10 tiles or so of your character, then hold x.
messagelist--ch3--msg36=If x is on a resource, you will hear your character mining it by hand.  You get one piece of coal a second or so.
messagelist--ch3--msg37=It doesn't matter how much coal you have at this moment, as long as it's at least a few pieces.
messagelist--ch3--msg38=It is time to place your first building.  To do so, open your inventory, find the mining drill, and press left bracket.
messagelist--ch3--msg39=We call left bracket clicking, and the tutorial will refer to it that way from now on.  It's like the mouse buttons: left bracket is left mouse button, and right bracket is right mouse button.  Where possible, we match the sighted meanings, though this is not always possible.
messagelist--ch3--msg40=When you click the drill, the mod puts it in your hand.  You may now build it by clicking the ground where you want it to be placed.
messagelist--ch3--msg41=Burner mining drills are 2 by 2, and mine everything directly under them.  So, a drill over coal gives coal.
messagelist--ch3--msg42=In some rare cases, patches generate close enough together that a drill on the edge can be on two patches at once. When that happens, you get both resources out of the drill.  But patches never overlap, that is there are never two resources on the same tile.  Because you are building near the center of the patch, this is not a concern even if your save did generate that way.
messagelist--ch3--msg43=You are holding it by the top left (northwest) corner.  In this case, it will extend one tile to the right and one tile down from your cursor's position.
messagelist--ch3--msg44=Use r to change the direction it will face.  It started facing north, but now is a good moment to become comfortable with the controls.  In this case, leave it facing north, so that it will match this tutorial.
messagelist--ch3--msg45=Note that shift r rotates counterclockwise.
messagelist--ch3--msg46=Now click the coal with it in your hand, and it will instantly build itself.
messagelist--ch3--msg47=Factorio never permanently takes a structure away.  You can get it back at no cost. To do so, just mine it.
messagelist--ch3--msg48=Once placed, move your cursor around a bit to see what the drill says.  In particular, note that it says it is out of fuel.
messagelist--ch3--msg49=Like your character, buildings can have inventories.  In this case, the drill has a fuel inventory.
messagelist--ch3--msg50=We will discuss your options in more detail later, but for now we will explain quick transfers.
messagelist--ch3--msg51=Go to your inventory and click coal to get it into your hand.  Then put your hand over the drill.
messagelist--ch3--msg52=Items in Factorio come in stacks.  Press shift q to find out what is in your hand, and what the stack size is.
messagelist--ch3--msg53=There are three controls to drop items.  Because dropping items is a physical action (not just configuration), your character must be close to the drill.
messagelist--ch3--msg54=The first is control left bracket, or control clicking.  With something in your hand that the machine "wants" and your hand over the machine, control click intelligently drops one whole stack of items into the most appropriate place.
messagelist--ch3--msg55=In this case, that's the fuel inventory, and the item is coal.
messagelist--ch3--msg56=If you don't have a full stack, it drops whatever you did have.
messagelist--ch3--msg57=Control right bracket, aka control right clicking, will drop half a stack.
messagelist--ch3--msg58=This works a bit differently when you do not have a full stack, however.  In that case, it drops half of what is left.
messagelist--ch3--msg59=Coal's stack size is 50.  So if you had 200 coal, it would drop 25.  But if you only had 10, it would only drop 5.
messagelist--ch3--msg60=The last option is z.  Z drops one item only.  This can be useful when you want to only put a little bit of something into a machine.
messagelist--ch3--msg61=Take some coal in hand, and use one of the above options to put it in the drill.
messagelist--ch3--msg62=You will hear the drill come on for a moment, then stop, even if you put 50 coal into it.
messagelist--ch3--msg63=If you put your cursor on the northwest corner of the drill, you will hear the word "output chute".  Drills drop stuff onto the ground one tile away from the output chute.  In this case, it is one tile north and a single piece of coal.  Find that now by moving your cursor around.
messagelist--ch3--msg64=When your character is physically on top of an item, you can pick it up by holding f.  Alternatively, tap x if it is in your character's reach and your cursor is on it.  We can't make those controls better.
messagelist--ch3--msg65=The problem you now have is that your drill has nowhere to put coal after it lets the first piece out.  The rule is that tiles on the ground can hold exactly one item each.  Even though coal stacks to 50, only one coal will come out at a time.  Unfortunately, the rules for when a machine will stop like that are not entirely consistent.  The other important cases work differently.
messagelist--ch3--msg66=We can fix this.  We will do so with a chest, in the next chapter where you learn how to craft items.
messagelist--ch3--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyM9NRykvMTVWyUkrOMFaqBQBm7weZ

messagelist--ch4--msg1=You now know enough to make progress, though not efficiently.  It is time to begin moving faster and opening up the game to you.  This is the part of the tutorial where things suddenly jump in complexity.
messagelist--ch4--msg2=You have accessed your inventory before.  Under that same UI are a bunch of others.  There are 3 mod UIs to concern yourself with, the main menu (e), the world menu (alt + w), and the mod configuration menu (control alt shift m).
messagelist--ch4--msg3=The latter two do not matter for a very long time, and we will not discuss them much.
messagelist--ch4--msg4=Mod UIs are divided into a two level hierarchy.
messagelist--ch4--msg5=The top-level hierarchy, tabs, are things like "inventories", "crafting", and "research".  You navigate between these with control tab and control shift tab.
messagelist--ch4--msg6=One level below that are subtabs or controls, navigated with tab and shift tab.  If you are in the inventories tab, this is every possible inventory for the building for example.
messagelist--ch4--msg7=UIs also offer a help system, available with shift slash.  Close help with e, returning to the UI you were in.
messagelist--ch4--msg8=There are two more important keys.  K, which gives you information on what is focused if such is available, and control + wasd, which moves as far as possible in a given direction. So for example, control w is top of menu.
messagelist--ch4--msg9=We will discuss research first.  While crafting lets us fix your drill, research is how you know why it matters and what to aim for.
messagelist--ch4--msg10=Open your main menu, then go over to the research tab.  This is composed of 3 rows one on top of the other: researchable, locked, and previously researched.
messagelist--ch4--msg11=Use w and s to switch rows, and a and d to explore the row.
messagelist--ch4--msg12=Many of our UIs are like this, taking a not intuitive "shape" to make it so that you don't have to scroll through long menus.
messagelist--ch4--msg13=Fortunately, every UI is searchable just like you searched your inventory earlier.
messagelist--ch4--msg14=Right now you have two researchable technologies, steam power and electronics.
messagelist--ch4--msg15=Factorio has two kinds of technology, technology which you select and technology which automatically unlocks.  Both currently available technologies have an unlock condition instead of a science requirement.  To find out what it is, press k.
messagelist--ch4--msg16=in this case, electronics is "craft copper plate x 10 of normal quality" and steam power is "craft iron plate x 50 of normal quality".
messagelist--ch4--msg17=Quality is a space age thing.  All you need to know is that you won't ever find a quality better than normal in the base game, what you are playing now.
messagelist--ch4--msg18=We now know what we need.  How do we get it?  Go back one tab to the crafting tab, then search for plate.
messagelist--ch4--msg19=If you click either of the plate recipes, the game will tell you that you can't craft it!  That's because these must be done in a machine.
messagelist--ch4--msg20=To find out what machines you can craft something in, press k.  This will also tell you what it needs as ingredients.
messagelist--ch4--msg21=You may also want to know what outputs of a recipe are for.  For this, press y to find out what kind of thing it is and what properties it has.
messagelist--ch4--msg22=We can't easily filter the list down to machines you have right now for a variety of reasons, but if you check all of them you will find out in this case that the one you have is a stone furnace.
messagelist--ch4--msg23=you started the game with one, but the reason that the stone from earlier in this tutorial is so useful is that you can now use it to make more.
messagelist--ch4--msg24=But now it's time to circle back.  The last chapter of this tutorial said we would teach you how to fix your burner mining drill.
messagelist--ch4--msg25=The punchline if you will is that stone furnaces require coal to function.  Coal and ore goes in and plates come out.  This is not obvious from the crafting menu, and indeed electric furnaces don't need the coal.  In general, you can recognize if a device needs fuel by seeing if it complains about not having any, or checking if it has a fuel inventory.
messagelist--ch4--msg26=If we don't have a stable supply of coal, it is not possible to make progress.
messagelist--ch4--msg27=We will fix this by making a wooden chest.  Use the scanner to find a tree, then let Kruise Kontrol mine a few for you.
messagelist--ch4--msg28=This will give you wood.  You will never have a shortage of wood because very few things use it, so don't worry about running out.
messagelist--ch4--msg29=Once you have some, you can craft a wooden chest.
messagelist--ch4--msg30=Earlier, you found where the burner mining drill drops coal.  Go back there (you can find the drill with the scanner), and place the chest on that tile.
messagelist--ch4--msg31=If the chest is in the right place and the drill has fuel, it will now begin to slowly fill the chest with coal.
messagelist--ch4--msg32=Soon, we will discuss more efficient ways to keep the burner mining drill going.  The important thing to know for now is that it produces more coal than it uses.
messagelist--ch4--msg33=That means that you can put coal from the drill back into the drill to keep it running.
messagelist--ch4--msg34=You have a few ways to get stuff out of the chest.
messagelist--ch4--msg35=First and second are control click/right click, like you are doing a smart insert, but this time with an empty hand.  In this case, the game will take things out intelligently.  For a chest, this is "remove everything".
messagelist--ch4--msg36=You empty your hand by pressing q.  Q serves a second function when your hand is already empty, however, so if it says it put something in your hand instead just hit q again.  We will talk about that in a little bit.
messagelist--ch4--msg37=Third is by opening the inventory itself.  You can click items to put them in hand, then press q to empty your hand to your inventory.  Alternatively, shift click will move things to your inventory one full slot at a time, and shift right click will move half of whatever is in the slot.
messagelist--ch4--msg38=We call these sibling inventories, and it also works in reverse.  If you explore the available tabs for the chest, you will see that the other one is your own inventory.  The shift click controls will work in your inventory to instead move things to the chest.
messagelist--ch4--msg39=Your responsibility for now is to keep an eye on this setup.  Every so often, the drill will require more fuel.  You will need to grab some coal from the chest and put it in the drill when it runs out.  Soon, we will have a few ways of fixing this that do not require you to keep checking in.
messagelist--ch4--msg40=Before we close this chapter, you should know that you are now producing pollution.  This tutorial doesn't spend much time on it because you are supposed to be in peaceful, but it does matter even there.
messagelist--ch4--msg41=As the game goes on, your factory produces pollution.  How much depends on how many machines you have built and how many are running at a given time.  This single drill produces a very small amount very slowly, but as you build more you produce it faster and faster.
messagelist--ch4--msg42=As enemy spawners see pollution, they get stronger.  And if you aren't in peaceful, they eventually come at you.
messagelist--ch4--msg43=Pollution spreads realistically as a cloud starting at your machines.  You can get the amount at your cursor with shift u.
messagelist--ch4--msg44=In the next chapter, we will talk about faster ways of moving around, then we will get to smelting to unlock those technologies.
messagelist--ch4--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyMdFRykvMTVWyUkrOMFGqBQBmtAeW

messagelist--ch5--msg1=Before we go further, it is now necessary for you to learn how to move around efficiently.  Until you can get a bit further, you have to monitor this drill setup and come back to it to get coal.  Soon, you will have lots of buildings and will need to navigate efficiently.  So how can we make that happen?  This short chapter teaches you what your options are.
messagelist--ch5--msg2=The first and simplest way is with bookmarks.  Pressing shift b sets a bookmark, and b returns the cursor to it.  You can put your cursor on the chest and hit shift b, for example.
messagelist--ch5--msg3=You only get one bookmark, so the second option is the fast travel menu. Opened with alt v, the fast travel menu lets you create named fast travel points.
messagelist--ch5--msg4=It consists of one row per point.  Each row has a number of commands.  Start by making a named travel point at your coal setup by putting your cursor where you want it and hitting create new, Typing a name, and hitting enter.
messagelist--ch5--msg5=Then, explore the menu to see what is available.
messagelist--ch5--msg6=The two most important items are teleport and move cursor, which are how you can monitor the drill.  Either teleport or move the cursor and use Kruise Kontrol when you need to get back to it.
messagelist--ch5--msg7=The third thing to discuss which doesn't fit nicely anywhere but which you need to know now is cursor skipping.
messagelist--ch5--msg8=Holding shift and using wasd moves your cursor up to 100 tiles in the given direction, stopping at the first change.
messagelist--ch5--msg9=What change means varies a little bit based on the situation, but it's usually what you would expect.
messagelist--ch5--msg10=In this case, use cursor skipping on your coal patch to find out how big it is in general, and what the shape is.  It should be reasonably self-explanatory.
messagelist--ch5--msg11=You will probably learn that it is much bigger than you thought.  Don't worry, it will be covered in drills soon enough.
messagelist--ch5--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNNRRykvMTVWyUkrOMFWqBQBmWgeR

messagelist--ch6--msg1=It is now time to set up a basic smelting setup.  Also, to stop ignoring the crash site.
messagelist--ch6--msg2=In order to do anything without having to come back to it all the time, we need a second drill.  But drills need plates to craft.  They also need stone furnaces.  Before going further, go find the burner mining drill recipe and check the ingredients.
messagelist--ch6--msg3=Iron gear wheel is also a recipe, taking 2 iron plates.  If you do the math, you need 9 iron plates and 5 stone.
messagelist--ch6--msg4=Fortunately, crafting is smart.  If you have enough and try to craft the drill, the game will craft the smaller things for you.
messagelist--ch6--msg5=Unfortunately, the mod is less smart.  We will try to tell you what's missing, but in this case we will for example claim it's the furnace.  So, you have to look a bit yourself.  The number you can craft is generally always correct, but figuring it out when it's zero is not.
messagelist--ch6--msg6=Now, we need 9 iron plates.  8 of them are easy.  They are in the crash site.  All of the crash site buildings may be mined, though they require holding x for a while to do it.  Some things in Factorio can be set to mine slower, and these are an example.  The buildings that contain items however are also containers, show up under the scanner as such, and support the container controls we taught in previous chapters.
messagelist--ch6--msg7=Choose whichever way you prefer to get the plates from the crash site pieces.
messagelist--ch6--msg8=The 9th plate has to come from our furnace.  Use your scanner to find a patch of iron ore, then travel to it. Next, mine in the same way you mined coal, until you have at least one iron ore.
messagelist--ch6--msg9=Once you do, pick a location to drop your furnace.  Usually, this is in the middle of the iron ore patch because drills can output to it directly.
messagelist--ch6--msg10=Then, use the controls of your choice to put both some coal and some iron ore in it.
messagelist--ch6--msg11=The mod introduces sounds for when various things happen, one of which is for when a crafting machine finishes crafting.  You will know that you have an iron plate because the furnace will play a soft beep, and moving your cursor over it will say that there is one ready as well.
messagelist--ch6--msg12=We link this to the zoom.  Change the zoom with dash and equals, which controls how much of your factory you hear around you at once, and also sets what is on screen from the sighted perspective.
messagelist--ch6--msg13=Drills are the only entity in Factorio which output their items directly onto the ground.  Furnaces have an output inventory, and will hold up to 100 plates before stopping.
messagelist--ch6--msg14=You can get the items out with any of the methods we have previously discussed.
messagelist--ch6--msg15=Since this is the first machine with multiple inventories, you can examine them by pressing tab with the machine's UI open.  To open a machine's UI, click it.
messagelist--ch6--msg16=The mod tries to allow you to open menus even if you have items in hand, but you may sometimes need to empty your hand especially if those items are buildings.  This is an unfortunate limitation we don't have a good way around.
messagelist--ch6--msg17=Whether you mine the crash site or smelt 9 plates directly, proceed until you can craft a second burner mining drill.
messagelist--ch6--msg18=You now have a choice to make.  You can use this burner mining drill in two ways.
messagelist--ch6--msg19=They are both the same mechanic.  If a burner mining drill is placed so that it would output into another building, it will drop the output there.
messagelist--ch6--msg20=For example, if you put it south of the furnace facing north, the northwest corner of the drill is just below the furnace and the furnace is in the same position as your chest from earlier.
messagelist--ch6--msg21=Your first choice is to take your drill, face it toward your furnace, and fuel it.  This will automate smelting, at least as long as both the drill and furnace have coal, and your job will be to make sure that fuel stays in all three places.
messagelist--ch6--msg22=The second option is a bit more subtle, though just as easy to set up.  You can also place this second drill facing your first drill on the coal patch, so that you always have coal ready.
messagelist--ch6--msg23=Remember that drills output more coal than they need as fuel.  If you fuel the back drill it can fuel the one in front of it.  Filling the back drill with coal is good for thousands of items.
messagelist--ch6--msg24=You can also face the drills toward each other.  In this case, they will fuel each other forever, and you can skim off the top.  You can extract all of the fuel from one drill with any of the quick transfer controls.  As long as you don't take from both, the setup will keep going, but unlike the chest it will stop and wait for you to take things out much sooner.
messagelist--ch6--msg25=We will teach you a more interesting setup later.  In a normal run, the above setups are needed to get you far enough to be crafting more complicated things, and those things are what let you build the more interesting options.
messagelist--ch6--msg26=For now your goal is to get 4 drills total, and a second furnace.
messagelist--ch6--msg27=once you have, use two drills to make a self-sustaining coal mine, then use the drill and furnace combination once on iron and once on copper.  Put fuel in everything, and let it run.
messagelist--ch6--msg28=Your goal for this chapter is to complete electronics and steam power.  If you do iron first and it is your first time through, that will probably happen around the time you finish setting things up.
messagelist--ch6--msg29=It's  a good idea to put fast travel points near your smelting setups.  Everything you craft by hand or otherwise is going to need plates.
messagelist--ch6--msg30=It is also a good time for us to talk about scanner subcategories.  You may have noticed that the scanner says things like "burner mining drill 1 of 2".
messagelist--ch6--msg31=This is because we group things into one more level.  When you place buildings that are similar to each other, or when you have multiple iron ore patches for example, we put them in a subcategory.  You navigate between instances with shift page up and down.
messagelist--ch6--msg32=If this seems inefficient now, it will make sense later.  This is how we make it possible to organize hundreds of buildings.
messagelist--ch6--msg33=Some things, for example forests, even split into multiple entries as you move closer.
messagelist--ch6--msg34=The reason that this is suddenly important is that furnaces are in categories.  In particular, all non-functional furnaces are in the same category.  Since a furnace changes what it is making based on what you put in it, the scanner cannot separate it out without it working on a recipe.
messagelist--ch6--msg35=Finally, you may want to know how close you are to finishing.  If you put a plate in hand and press u, the mod is able to tell you how many you have made so far.  This also works on any recipe in the crafting menu.
messagelist--ch6--msg36=Before continuing, you should work by yourself to unlock both electronics and steam power.  If you are able to get here with lots of time to spare, feel free to read ahead and congratulations on being a skilled player.
messagelist--ch6--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNtNRykvMTVWyUkrOMFOqBQBmyAeZ

messagelist--ch7--msg1=It is now time to set up power.
messagelist--ch7--msg2=Before you continue with this tutorial, use your knowledge to craft a steam engine, a boiler, an offshore pump, a lab, a pipe to ground, 4 or 5 regular pipes, and at least one electric pole.
messagelist--ch7--msg3=You could also craft transport belts and inserters, but we don't teach those now because you need a whole bunch to do anything with them.  On future runs, this is a place where you would start automating things while you wait, but for the sake of learning we choose to delay that a little bit longer.
messagelist--ch7--msg4=You should know enough from previous chapters to get this far without our help.  The only thing that is new is that the electric pole recipe outputs two electric poles per run, which means that if you do the math you will find that it is taking 0.5 wood each.
messagelist--ch7--msg5=In those cases, it is never possible to just craft one.  You will always get at least two.
messagelist--ch7--msg6=Once you craft the lab, the technology automation science pack will complete itself, and you have now reached the first set of traditional technologies and the main driving loop of Factorio.
messagelist--ch7--msg7=You should take this time to check a few things.  This tutorial will spell out what they are, because they are how you find out what to do next in general.
messagelist--ch7--msg8=First find the technology "logistic science pack".  To figure out what to aim for, you always aim for the next science pack, at least until you can research the rocket silo.
messagelist--ch7--msg9=If you press k on it, you'll notice that this takes 75 automation science packs.
messagelist--ch7--msg10=Next, find the automation science pack recipe.  Notice that it takes 5 seconds on top of the ingredients.  Those ingredients also take time.
messagelist--ch7--msg11=If you did this by hand, it would take quite a long time.  Later technologies need multiple science packs at once, and run into the hundreds and even the thousands.  Until now, Factorio may have felt like a weird survival game or something.  But now you are at the core of the game, and the core of the game is figuring out how to scale up production to meet the demand of the labs.
messagelist--ch7--msg12=In fact, by the end of the game, even a sighted player doesn't have to walk to build, as their robots will just do it for them.
messagelist--ch7--msg13=Sometimes, your next science pack is locked until you meet the prerequisites. In this case, you find it in the row of locked technologies.
messagelist--ch7--msg14=Since there's a ton of technologies, we will provide a minor spoiler.  You want to unlock logistic science pack.  From there, you can do chemical and military science packs.  After that, production and utility science packs are doable, and with all of them unlocked you can research the silo and win the game.
messagelist--ch7--msg15=The research you actually care about right now is "automation", which gets you an assembling machine.  Assembling machines craft for you.  When fed ingredients, they can make anything you can make.  The version you unlock now is slower than you, but you can run as many as you can supply at a time.
messagelist--ch7--msg16=This tutorial keeps giving you item properties, but now is a good time to tell you how to get those yourself.
messagelist--ch7--msg17=k also works in your inventory, and provides a lot of details.  It also works on the map, though the map version is much less verbose.
messagelist--ch7--msg18=y in the crafting menu will tell you what all of the products of a recipe do.  On the map, it reads all of the properties of the item in hand.
messagelist--ch7--msg19=This chapter of the tutorial has an attached set of example blueprints.  What we are about to explain is complicated, and so to help you we have given you as many pieces as we can if you need to look at them.
messagelist--ch7--msg20=Blueprints are like buildings, but place more than one structure at a time and place what are called ghosts instead of real structures.  If you have the items, invoking Kruise Kontrol on a ghost will build all ghosts it can find, filling out the blueprint for you.
messagelist--ch7--msg21=in this way, you can share structures with others.
messagelist--ch7--msg22=Like with buildings, you are building from the northwest corner of the setup.
messagelist--ch7--msg23=The two example blueprints here are the boiler assembly we are about to describe, and an example of a working pipe to ground pair.
messagelist--ch7--msg24=These blueprints are permanent items which go to your inventory when your hand is emptied.  You can destroy them instead with control backspace, either from the map with it in your hand or from an inventory with it focused.
messagelist--ch7--msg25=Control backspace is dangerous delete, which is used when destroying something in a way you can't get it back. This applies to various kinds of items containing data, but to answer a commonly asked question, you cannot destroy regular physical items this way.  Indeed the only way to destroy regular items is to put them in a chest, then shoot the chest.
messagelist--ch7--msg26=The first thing you want to do now is find water.  This is in the resource category of your scanner.  Your cursor is placed on the part of the water closest to your character.  Get your character over there.  Note that your character cannot swim, so you need it to be on land.
messagelist--ch7--msg27=this tutorial will explain the setup from the south to north.  The setup we are going to build is 3 tiles wide and 11 tiles high.  You will want to use cursor skipping to make sure you have enough room, and you will want it to be near water.
messagelist--ch7--msg28=the southmmost building to place is a boiler facing north.  This is a 3 wide by 2 high building that converts water to steam.
messagelist--ch7--msg29=Once you have placed it, explore it and you will find 3 connection points on the edge.  On the southwest and southeast corners are two water connections, and in the middle of the north side is where steam comes out.  The mod tells you which direction the connection faces.  In this case, the southwest connection faces west, and the southeast connection faces east.
messagelist--ch7--msg30=To connect entities that use fluids together, you place a pipe or another entity next to the connection point in the direction it is facing. So, in this case, a pipe to the west of the boiler's southwest corner would work.  Being to the west does matter.
messagelist--ch7--msg31=Also notice that the mod doesn't say that the water connections are inputs.  The convention here is that the mod doesn't say when it can go in both directions.  You can connect a line of boilers together and give water to the first one, and everything in line will get some.
messagelist--ch7--msg32=Next, place the steam engine.  It is 3 wide by 5 high.  Count 5 tiles up from the northwest corner of the boiler.
messagelist--ch7--msg33=If you explore the steam engine, you will see that it has a bidirectional steam connection at the top center and bottom center.  If you placed it right, the south-facing steam connection is one tile north of the boiler's north-facing output, and the setup is now 3 wide by 7 high.
messagelist--ch7--msg34=In a minute, we will give the boiler water and fuel, and that will fill the steam engine with steam.  When you scale power, you can stack multiple steam engines on top of each other, and they can feed each other.
messagelist--ch7--msg35=Third, north of the northwest corner of the steam engine, place a small electric pole.
messagelist--ch7--msg36=Electric poles move electricity.  The game automatically handles wires, so you can think of them like wireless power transmitters.
messagelist--ch7--msg37=They have two values, the supply range and the wire reach. Don't worry about the wire reach for now, as we will cover it in a later chapter.
messagelist--ch7--msg38=The supply area of a small electric pole is a 5x5 box with the pole at the center.  If any part of an adjacent building is in that box, it will interface with this electric pole.  Electric pole supply areas are always presented like this, as well as most other "box"-shaped ranges.
messagelist--ch7--msg39=Right now your electric pole is feeding from the steam engine because the steam engine is in range.  It doesn't matter where it is relative to the steam engine, as long as it is close enough.
messagelist--ch7--msg40=Next, count 3 north from the pole and place the lab, making the setup 3 tiles wide by 11 tiles high.
messagelist--ch7--msg41=Now we need to get this setup some water.
messagelist--ch7--msg42=Offshore pumps draw water from water tiles, but they have a complicated placing rule.  Most players will only ever place one or two for the entire game, so we offer a helper menu.
messagelist--ch7--msg43=The rule for an offshore pump is that it is 3 wide by 2 high.  The frontmost tiles must all be over water and the middle of the back must be over land.  Water then comes out the center of the back.
messagelist--ch7--msg44=To get to the helper menu, get your character near water, put an offshore pump in hand, and alt click.  This will give you a list of candidate locations. Click one, and the pump will build.  Then, find the pump with your scanner.
messagelist--ch7--msg45=Pipes are a little bit magical.  Factorio models fluids as instant teleportation.  If a pipe has water in it and something at the other end needs it, then the thing at the other end gets the water even if it is a very long pipe.  Factorio limits this to around 300 tiles, and counts buildings in that length. Later on, you may see a "pipeline overextended" error.  In that case, you have to make it shorter or use pumps, which you unlock later.
messagelist--ch7--msg46=Careful here.  Offshore pumps and pumps are not the same thing.
messagelist--ch7--msg47=Factorio also does not allow mixing two fluids in the same pipe.  That doesn't matter much now, but will definitely matter later.
messagelist--ch7--msg48=The placement rule for pipes is that a pipe connects to everything it can. So, if you place 9 pipes in a 3x3 box, you get a 3x3 pipe-like thing where all pipes connect up.  In this case, putting a pipe next to the boiler's water connections connects it to the boiler, putting a pipe next to the water output of the offshore pump connects it to the offshore pump, and drawing a line of pipes to the boiler connects the boiler to the water.
messagelist--ch7--msg49=You can tell if the pipe is working because the offshore pump, all of the pieces of the pipe, and the boiler will all say they have water in them.  Each pipe segment holds up to 100 units, ready to be dispensed to whatever needs it.
messagelist--ch7--msg50=Unfortunately, you cannot walk through pipes.  That is one of the functions of a pipe to ground.
messagelist--ch7--msg51=The pipe to ground is more complicated.  It only connects to a pipe "in front" of it.  That is, if you face it north it must be south of a pipe to connect.  The facing direction is the above ground portion of an underground pipe tunnel.
messagelist--ch7--msg52=If you place two in a line close enough together, they connect underground.  The rule is that they may be separated up to 9 tiles.  So, you could place one facing west at say (5, 0), and that would connect to a second one facing east at (10, 0).
messagelist--ch7--msg53=If you then placed a third facing east at (7, 0), though, it would link to (5, 0) and disconnect (10, 0).
messagelist--ch7--msg54=You can visualize these exactly like a buried garden hose, where the hose ends are the pieces that you are placing and they are pointing in the direction you should face those pieces.
messagelist--ch7--msg55=The other function of a pipe to ground is to let you run pipes close together without mixing fluids.  Unfortunately, practical examples of doing that are many hours away.
messagelist--ch7--msg56=In either case, your immediate goal is to hand-craft 10 automation science packs, get water and coal in the boiler, put the science packs in the lab, then click on automation in the research tab.
messagelist--ch7--msg57=Research is queued, and clicking puts it in the back of the queue. Since you haven't got anything else running, it's up next.  Check research progress with t, and if you want to cancel get to the research queue by tabbing over from the technology list and clicking what you want to cancel.
messagelist--ch7--msg58=You can also enqueue to the front with control shift click.
messagelist--ch7--msg59=If everything is working, your steam engine, lab, and boiler will all begin to make audible noise.  All factorio buildings make some sound when they are working, so sudden silence is usually the sign of a problem.
messagelist--ch7--msg60=To finish out this stage and move onto inserters, assemblers, and transport belts, you should complete the automation research.
messagelist--ch7--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyM9BRykvMTVWyUkrOMFeqBQBmoQeX

messagelist--ch8--msg1=It is now time to talk about transport belts and inserters.  We will also discuss the quickbar, which will get rid of the need to open your inventory all the time, and the pipette tool, which lets you quickly grab more things if your cursor is over one on the map.
messagelist--ch8--msg2=Please bear with us, as this chapter doesn't have much "now go play the game" content.  You need this chapter and the next one before you can get back to serious building.
messagelist--ch8--msg3=We will revisit transport belts one more time in the future to talk about their more complicated possibilities, and do a brief revisit of inserters at that time for a few more features as well.
messagelist--ch8--msg4=Since this is a lot of information, what we are going to build at the end is one version of a scalable coal setup.  We will teach you how to scale it later, but this is the first repeating pattern: something which makes a bigger version when built next to a copy of itself.
messagelist--ch8--msg5=Inserters are the easiest to understand.  An inserter is a robotic hand.  It swings back and forth grabbing stuff and putting it where it needs to go.
messagelist--ch8--msg6=It is important to be aware that factorio actually does a physical simulation of the hand.  For that reason, numbers like "x items per second" are not as meaningful as you might want.  Maybe there's not enough items right now.  And of course the throughput from a chest to a belt is different than from a chest to a chest, because they have slightly different shapes on the map.
messagelist--ch8--msg7=To report this to you, we tell you the approximate number of swings per second.  An inserter faces what it is going to pick up from, grabs stuff, swings around half a circle, and drops stuff.  Then it returns to the start.
messagelist--ch8--msg8=For example, an inserter doing 1 swing per second completes a full circle once per second.
messagelist--ch8--msg9=When inserters aren't busy, they idle at their starting location.
messagelist--ch8--msg10=In addition to reporting numbers to you, we also add sounds when your cursor is over an inserter. The high click is the inserter reaching the start location, and the lower pitched click is it reaching the endpoint to drop stuff off.  You can use this to get a feel for how fast they are, as well as whether or not a given inserter is always busy.  We don't play these sounds all the time because you will have too many inserters for that to be practical.
messagelist--ch8--msg11=An inserter always picks up from one tile in front of it, and it always drops off to one tile behind it.  If there isn't an entity in front of it, it will pick up from the ground instead, and if there isn't an entity behind it, it will drop to the ground.  Just like with drills, the one item per tile rule applies here, so an inserter using the ground to move stuff is very, very slow.  It will become more clear later why this is the case.
messagelist--ch8--msg12=To determine what to pick up, it looks at the entity it is going to drop items into, and sees what that entity needs.  For example a chest takes anything, but a crafting machine needs only the ingredients for the set recipe.  If any of these things are in front of it, it will pick them up.
messagelist--ch8--msg13=To determine where to drop it off, it does the same thing as control clicking, and intelligently picks the best inventory in the target.
messagelist--ch8--msg14=You currently have two kinds of inserter: the burner inserter and the inserter.  The difference is that inserters take electricity, but burner inserters run on fuel.
messagelist--ch8--msg15=Burner inserters are what you need to start with, because they function without electricity.  Instead, they take fuel.  This works identically to every other entity that takes fuel which you have encountered so far.
messagelist--ch8--msg16=A burner inserter is a little bit smart.  When it needs fuel and it also happens to be moving fuel, it will take some of the fuel for itself.
messagelist--ch8--msg17=That means that burner inserters moving iron need refuelling, but burner inserters moving coal will take a bit of the coal as needed.
messagelist--ch8--msg18=The only other fuel you currently have access to is wood.
messagelist--ch8--msg19=If you want to practice, you can make two chests and a burner inserter.  Place the burner inserter between the two chests facing toward one of them, then put a stack of coal in the chest in front of it.  The coal will then move to the chest behind it, minus the little bit the inserter took for itself.  This chapter attaches that as  an example blueprint, coal not included.
messagelist--ch8--msg20=The inserter needs power.  It otherwise works the same way, but it must be in the supply range of a power pole.  We aren't using it yet because it is not practical to wire a bunch of things up to your steam engines when you still have to run around to fuel them.  If you do that, you will get stuck fuelling them all the time, and won't have the time you need to build other things.
messagelist--ch8--msg21=Now let's switch focus.  Transport belts are conveyor belts.  For playability, they do not require electricity to function.  Each transport belt covers one tile.  Transport belts move items in the direction they are facing.  For example a belt facing north moves items north.
messagelist--ch8--msg22=Each belt is also divided into two lanes.  You can think of it like cars on a highway, except the lanes go in the same direction and items never switch lanes.  The game does not stop mixing items or anything like that, to be clear.  The reason we will be revisiting belts later is because you need to understand how to manipulate and use the lanes.  But for now, you can mostly ignore them.
messagelist--ch8--msg23=If you want a good way of thinking of it, there are two smaller belts next to each other on the tile facing in the direction you placed the larger one.
messagelist--ch8--msg24=To form belt corners, you place a few straight belts and then face the one at the end in the new direction.  If you do it right, the mod will announce that the last piece as a corner when you move the cursor over the tile.  There are no specific dedicated shapes.  The engine just looks at the orientations and goes "yes this is the right placement for a corner" and magically forms it.
messagelist--ch8--msg25=If you do it wrong, you may get a sideload (which we discuss later) or a unit (which means that you have a belt facing entirely backward).
messagelist--ch8--msg26=To put it simply, place a belt facing north.  Then move one tile north and place a belt facing east.  This formed a corner, and the mod will tell you where.
messagelist--ch8--msg27=Each individual belt holds 8 items, 4 on each lane, and moves a certain number of items per second.  Right now, the basic transport belt you have access to moves 15 items per second, or 900 per minute.  Being aware of these numbers and using u to track logistics is a good way to keep on top of whether or not something is wrong with your factory.  For example if you only have one belt of iron plates and are producing 900 per minute, adding more furnaces can't help until you also figure out more belts.
messagelist--ch8--msg28=To find out these sorts of numbers, right click the belt on the map for a much more verbose description of the entity.  This works on most things to provide you with information that you don't usually need, either because it is not super important or because you will memorize it over time.
messagelist--ch8--msg29=Here is the trick this chapter teaches.  The drill outputs more coal than it needs by a lot.  So we can take a belt from the drill to where we want to go, and as long as we are clever about it, we can also pull some of the coal back in with a burner inserter at the same time.  This is attached as an example blueprint as well.  It is much easier to look at than it is to explain.
messagelist--ch8--msg30=To build this, you set up a 2 wide by 4 high setup with the burner mining drill taking the bottom half facing north.
messagelist--ch8--msg31=Then you place a belt unit facing north at the drill's output, and two belt units facing east across the top.
messagelist--ch8--msg32=One tile in this setup is empty, and it is perfectly positioned for an inserter.  Placing an inserter in it facing north will grab coal from the belt and put it back in the drill.
messagelist--ch8--msg33=You can then run belts from that to wherever you want coal to go.
messagelist--ch8--msg34=If you did it right, coal exits from the northeast corner going east.  Don't forget that everything rotates, including blueprints.  Whether you build it yourself or rotate the example blueprint attached to this chapter, you can also build a version of this where coal exits west from the southwest corner, or even north from the northwest corner.  It all depends on the orientation of the first drill.
messagelist--ch8--msg35=Though not related to this chapter as such, it is important to highlight that you must supply the first piece of coal to start the drill.
messagelist--ch8--msg36=The rule to get items onto belts is simple.  It either needs an inserter dropping to it or it needs to be at the output tile of a drill.
messagelist--ch8--msg37=The rule to get items off belts is even simpler.  Getting items off belts always uses an inserter, without exception.  Items do not flow off the end.  Instead, full belts stop moving until there is space.
messagelist--ch8--msg38=No machine besides drills outputs items to the ground.  All other machines must use inserters to move things as well.
messagelist--ch8--msg39=If you want to get things off belts manually, teleport your character onto the belt and hold f.  The mod makes a best effort attempt to report what you are picking up, but this is highly inaccurate especially when belts don't have lots of items on them.
messagelist--ch8--msg40=Finally, it is time to discuss the quickbar and pipette tool.  The numbers 1 through 0 are a standard game-style quickbar which may have items assigned to it.
messagelist--ch8--msg41=To assign items, put them in your hand, and press control plus the number.
messagelist--ch8--msg42=Later, pressing  the number will bring the item to hand as long as you have some in your inventory.
messagelist--ch8--msg43=To clear a slot, assign the empty hand to it.
messagelist--ch8--msg44=10 slots is a pretty small number.  For that reason, you actually have 10 quickbars.  You change the active quickbar with shift 1 through 0.  To assign to further quickbars, switch to them, then assign as described above.  Quickbars do not change on you without you first pressing a number.
messagelist--ch8--msg45=A very good way to do this is to have a quickbar per category.  For example, quickbar 1 can be all kinds of belts, 2 can be all kinds of inserters, 3 can be for power, etc.
messagelist--ch8--msg46=The pipette tool is much more situational, but invaluable when it applies.  You invoke it by pressing q.  When  your hand is full q empties it, but when your hand is empty the pipette tool is invoked instead.
messagelist--ch8--msg47=This is a bit like the smart inserting we did earlier, but in reverse.  Pipette on a building brings more of that building to your hand.  Pipette on water grabs an offshore pump.  Pipette on a resource grabs a drill.  Etc.  Try it to learn what it does.  Also, expect this list to grow slowly over time.
messagelist--ch8--msg48=One reason pipette is valuable is because sometimes you are working with buildings for a little while that you will not touch again for hours.  An example of this could be storage tanks, if you limit yourself to what you have unlocked now.  There are many more later.
messagelist--ch8--msg49=In that case, it is often more convenient to use pipette than it is to set up a whole quickbar of stuff.
messagelist--ch8--msg50=It also works on ghosts, to put the item for the ghost in your hand.  Using pipette on a ghost gives you what you need to build it. Moving to the top left corner and placing it will then place it over the ghost, and copy the settings.
messagelist--ch8--msg51=The final advantage of the pipette tool is that it matches the direction of the item on the ground.  You may quickly notice and likely be irritated by the quickbar always facing your hand to the north.  Pipette on a south-facing belt gets you a belt of the same kind facing in the same direction, not just a belt facing north.
messagelist--ch8--msg52=To move on, we will next discuss building long lines of things.  If you want to, you should now know enough to automate power.  But this will require placing hundreds of belt segments by hand, tile by tile.  The next chapter covers your alternatives.
messagelist--ch8--msg53=If you want something to be doing while you continue reading, now is a good time to start crafting belts. A hundred or so can't hurt to say the least.  Note that the belt recipe is like the power pole, and outputs 2 belts per run.
messagelist--ch8--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNdZRykvMTVWyUkrOsFCqBQBmwQea

messagelist--ch9--msg1=It is now time to talk about rulers, build lock, and the clipboard.  These are your tools for building long lines.
messagelist--ch9--msg2=Build lock is the most important.  When build lock is enabled, every movement of your character builds behind your character.
messagelist--ch9--msg3=Movements of your cursor also try to build one tile behind your cursor (for example pressing once builds on the current tile then moves), but game API limitations prevent this from working nicely, and it is best avoided.
messagelist--ch9--msg4=Walking in general is not advantageous, but there is one exception: walking an already known to be cleared line.
messagelist--ch9--msg5=If you know you want to build 200 transport belts in a line, you can turn build lock on, use the arrow keys to run the line, then fix the ends.  The ends will usually be a few tiles longer than you wanted.
messagelist--ch9--msg6=To use build lock, toggle it with control b.  It turns itself off if your hand is emptied, if you hit control b again, or if you run into an obstacle that pushes you in an unexpected direction.
messagelist--ch9--msg7=Most of the time build lock is equivalent to just building by hand, as if you had moved the cursor along the line and clicked all the buttons.  But there are two important cases where this is not true because we offer more convenient behaviors instead.
messagelist--ch9--msg8=The first one is transport belts.  For transport belts, the belts follow your character and turn as your character does. You run in the direction you want the belt to go, and the belts follow you around.  Generally you don't want to use this to make corners, but you can if precision isn't something you care much about this time.
messagelist--ch9--msg9=The other case is electric poles.  For electric poles, we place them at the maximum reach to connect to the last one in the chain.  So for small electric poles the first one is always placed as soon as possible, then every 7 tiles thereafter.
messagelist--ch9--msg10=We closed the last chapter by setting up your self-maintaining coal mine, but your steam engine and boiler is probably very far away because it needs to be near water.  Now you have a tool to make the line conveniently.  Work out where the long line needs to be, turn build lock on, and run it. Then change the ends to where they need to be.  If you used the transport belt version of the sustaining coal mine, the input end needs to be at that belt, and then the output end goes within one tile of the boiler so an inserter can reach it.
messagelist--ch9--msg11=If you do this right, then you now have a power setup that will run until the drill runs out of coal. That enables you to use inserters and electric mining drills.  We will talk more about electric mining drills in a little bit.
messagelist--ch9--msg12=You probably care about precision.  There are two tools to help with this, one from vanilla and one from the mod.
messagelist--ch9--msg13=The mod offers audio rulers.  You place the audio ruler with control alt b, and clear it with alt shift b.
messagelist--ch9--msg14=When your cursor lines up with the audio ruler, you hear a tone.  The two low tones indicate that you are within one tile of the line, and the high tone indicates perfect alignment.  The actual point itself makes a click instead.
messagelist--ch9--msg15=You should take a moment to place an audio ruler and to move around to see what shape it projects.  It specifically forms a cross going to infinity in all directions.
messagelist--ch9--msg16=The audio ruler works with cursor skipping. When cursor skipping, your cursor will stop at the audio ruler instead of continuing past it.
messagelist--ch9--msg17=It also works with your character.  Your character walking through a ruler also plays the tones.
messagelist--ch9--msg18=What it does not do is turn build lock off.  We cannot know if that's why you wanted the ruler, so it is your responsibility not to keep running once you hit it.
messagelist--ch9--msg19=As a concrete example, you can place an audio ruler at your boiler, use cursor skipping to see how far it is, then run a belt until it hits the ruler before turning toward the boiler.
messagelist--ch9--msg20=The thing vanilla offers which we interface with is the clipboard.  You have worked with blueprints before.  The clipboard is just like that, but the blueprints it makes delete themselves when you press q.
messagelist--ch9--msg21=To use it, you press control c to get the copy tool, then you click two points.  The mod will take everything inside that box and turn it into a blueprint.  Just like the other blueprints you have seen, it can be rotated.
messagelist--ch9--msg22=To keep a copy, you can open your inventory and click an empty slot.  Be careful.  Vanilla and the mod both keep blueprints around if you empty your hand by swapping to something else using the inventory controls.
messagelist--ch9--msg23=Cut also works the same way, but introduces a new status: marked for deconstruction.  Entities which are marked for deconstruction are deconstructed by automated tools that you unlock later, but they can also be deconstructed by KK and have new blueprints placed over them.
messagelist--ch9--msg24=Cut will take the box you mark and mark everything in it for destruction, then give you a blueprint of what was there.
messagelist--ch9--msg25=You can use cut to grab a large setup and move it sideways by a few tiles for example, by just placing the blueprint and invoking KK.
messagelist--ch9--msg26=Just like a traditional clipboard, you can get whatever is on the clipboard back with control v.
messagelist--ch9--msg27=Unfortunately, we must now discuss an edge case.  Sighted players build from the center of buildings and blueprints, not from the northwest corner.  For this reason, the mod has to compute the dimensions of the blueprint by what is in it.  This means that if you put one entity in the blueprint and then select a 1000 by 1000 box, you will only get the one entity.  If that's a chest, your blueprint is only 1 by 1!
messagelist--ch9--msg28=This can also get tricky because there is not necessarily an entity at every corner.  To make an example, place 4 chests in a square, delete the northwest chest, and then blueprint it.  You will find that your blueprint is still 4 by 4, and that when placed your cursor is over the hole!
messagelist--ch9--msg29=These are very important points to remember.  If you ever need to force a blueprint to be a certain size, consider some cheap wooden chests at all 4 corners.
messagelist--ch9--msg30=It is perhaps not immediately obvious why this belongs here, so here is how you use it to build a line.
messagelist--ch9--msg31=Place 5 belt segments.  Say facing east.  Hit control c, click the first belt segment, hit shift d to skip to the eastern end, and click again.  You now have a blueprint of 5 belt segments in your hand.
messagelist--ch9--msg32=You can now move one tile past the end of the belt, place it, cursor skip over the ghosts, place it, etc. as many times as you want.  Each one extends the belt by 5.
messagelist--ch9--msg33=You can blueprint ghosts without building them, so you can use this to make a line of 20 belts, then copy the whole line of 20.  Now you're placing 20 at a time.
messagelist--ch9--msg34=It's even easier than this though.  The mod offers another feature, skip by preview.  Instead of hitting shift wasd, hit control wasd.
messagelist--ch9--msg35=In this case, you move by the exact width or height of what you are holding, without regard to the ground.  This also respects rotation.
messagelist--ch9--msg36=So, instead of pressing a bunch of keys, you could press control d, click, control d, click,  over and over as fast as possible.
messagelist--ch9--msg37=When placing blueprints, the distance from your character doesn't matter because you are only placing ghosts.  Once you have built a long line, KK can build it out for you and will handle the running around.
messagelist--ch9--msg38=Blueprints deal with trees for you by marking them for deconstruction.  So when KK builds it, KK will clear the area.
messagelist--ch9--msg39=Now that you are armed with these tools, you should be able to complete your power setup.
messagelist--ch9--msg40=As stated previously though, power does not run unless there is something that needs it.  So, we will jump ahead a little bit.  The one thing you can craft right now which will always use power no matter what is the accessibility radar.  Craft one of these and use it to test your power setup.  We will explain what it is for later, but placing one as soon as possible and leaving it on is something you want to do.
messagelist--ch9--msg41=Right clicking on power poles gives you more information, including satisfaction, an abstract measure of how well you are doing at meeting the electrical demands of your machines.  Now is a good time to figure out how this all looks when it is working correctly.
messagelist--ch9--msg42=Soon, you will need to scale your power output, which means connecting more boilers and steam engines up.  If you know what it looks like when it is working correctly, then you will have an easier time recognizing when there is a problem or a need for more power.

messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg1=This is a low-level equipment grid view.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg2=If you are just trying to equip things for the first time, you probably want the equipment overview tab.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg3=In Factorio, equipment goes into this grid and has dimensions. For example 1 by 1 or 2 by 4.

This is limited by the game, not by the mod.  If you cannot move items around with the free space in the grid, you have to remove them and put them back.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg11=Press backspace to order equipment removed from this grid.  The difference is that the equipment will be removed by bots, once you have unlocked them.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNNRRykvMTVWyUkotLM0syE3NK9FNL8pM0c1IzSlQqgUAHQ4OEg==

messagelist--general-ui-help--msg1=This is a UI.  All UIs in Factorio Access have similar controls.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg2=Press w, a, s, and d to move around.  Add ctrl to go as far as possible in the given direction.  For example ctrl w moves to the top of menus.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg3=To get out of all UIs, press e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg4=To find out what UI you are in, press shift e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg5=Sometimes you are in a nested UI, for example opening a menu inside a menu. To go back one level, press alt e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg6=Press ctrl tab and ctrl shift tab to cycle between tabs.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg7=Press tab and shift tab to cycle between subtabs.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg8=If the difference between tabs and subtabs does not make sense, try playing with your main menu, opened by pressing e on the map.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg9=UIs come in many different shapes and sizes.  The three most common are grids, menus, and category-based views.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg10=When in a UI without an obvious shape, we will give you information on what you need to press.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg11=Generally, grids are grids, menus are vertical options sometimes with horizontal commands on a row, and category-based views are like grids but the rows are of different lengths depending on how big the category is.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg12=The reason this isn't simple is because being able to move sideways lets us group commands in rows with the thing they control, so that you don't have to arrow past all of them when you don't care about them.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg13=basic interaction is called clicking, and is done with left or right bracket plus modifiers.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg14=For example shift click is shift left bracket.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg15=To trigger buttons or otherwise perform the primary action, you click.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg16=Other menus sometimes use modifiers and right click, which are generally documented in their help text.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg17=You can search all menus.  To set your search pattern, press ctrl f, type what you want to search, and hit enter.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg18=To cycle through search results, use shift enter for next and ctrl shift enter for previous.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg19=A small number of menus support drag.  When dragging is supported, you drag by adding shift to the movement keys.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg20=An even smaller number of menus support typing alternate values. This comes up for example when dealing with circuit conditions.  To type a value, you press m.  Menus tell you when this will work.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg21=Finally, backspace and ctrl backspace are delete/clear keys.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg22=Backspace does safe clearing.  This means setting a value back to zero or flushing a fluid.  Clearing done with backspace is safe because it can be recovered from easily.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg23=Ctrl backspace does dangerous delete.  This does things like permanently destroy blueprints!  Be careful.
messagelist--general-ui-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyMtZRykvMTVWyUkpPzUstSszRLc3UzUjNKVCqBQDjugxT

messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg1=This is an inventory, a 10 by some number of rows grid.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg2=Inventories have some number of slots. When that is not a multiple of 10, the bottom row has some unusable cells.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg3=To take a stack to your hand, click it.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg4=Right click takes half a stack instead.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg5=k gives you more information on an item.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg6=To put an item into the inventory, click an empty slot with that item in hand.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg7=You can use shift click to move stacks to sibling inventories.  This does not work in the main menu, but does work when an entity is open.  Shift right click instead moves half.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg8=Sometimes it is necessary to do something with an item without removing it.  You do this with ctrl shift click.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg9=Ctrl shift click with a repair pack repairs.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg10=Ctrl shift click on equipment tries to quickly equip it to the open entity.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg11=Ctrl shift click on a blueprint book with a blueprint in hand adds the blueprint to the book.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg12=A sibling inventory is your inventory if you are in the entity, or the entity's main inventory if you are in yours.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg13=For example, this can be used to quickly move things to and from chests.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg14=As a reminder, your inventory is available as the last tab in an entity's tabs, if that entity uses inventories.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg15=You may delete planners, blueprints, and books with ctrl backspace.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNNVRykvMTVWyUsrMK0vNK8kvqtRNL8pM0c1IzSlQqgUAHsoOLA==

messagelist--map-help--msg1=This is the map view, which allows you to explore your local surface.  Please note that this menu is contextual, and will reveal more information for items that have special interactions.  That information will appear above this message so that you can easily find it.
messagelist--map-help--msg2=The following is a brief overview of basic controls. Please see the mod readme and the vanilla Factorio wiki for complete documentation of controls.
messagelist--map-help--msg3=Not all keys are provided by the mod.  Factorio itself has many keys not covered here.
messagelist--map-help--msg4=You have a cursor and a character.  Your cursor is like the mouse. Your character is your body.
messagelist--map-help--msg5=Your cursor is completely separate from your character, but your character must be close enough to things to build or configure them. In vanilla, this is around 10 tiles.
messagelist--map-help--msg6=To walk, use the arrow keys.
messagelist--map-help--msg7=To move the cursor, press w, a, s, and d.
messagelist--map-help--msg8=You can teleport with shift t.  This is a cheat, but many players find that it is fair because we are slower in many other aspects.
messagelist--map-help--msg9=When your cursor is on an entity, it is selected.
messagelist--map-help--msg10=Use k to get more information on the selected entity or what is in your hand.
messagelist--map-help--msg11=Right bracket provides even more information on the selected entity.
messagelist--map-help--msg12=Use q to empty your hand or perform the pipette action.  Use shift q to read your hand's contents.
messagelist--map-help--msg13=Use control left bracket to drop full stacks from your hand into the selected entity.
messagelist--map-help--msg14=Control right bracket drops a half stack instead.
messagelist--map-help--msg15=z drops one item.
messagelist--map-help--msg16=Picking loose items up is done by putting your character near them and holding f, or by mining them with x.
messagelist--map-help--msg17=Only holding f works if you want to grab from a belt, as mining removes the belt instead.
messagelist--map-help--msg18=j will return your cursor to your character, and i will toggle whether your cursor moves 1 tile in front of you when walking.
messagelist--map-help--msg19=Add shift to the cursor movement keys to move up to 100 tiles in any given direction, stopping early if an important change is found.
messagelist--map-help--msg20=Use control plus the cursor keys to move by the width or height of your item in hand, which can be used to easily build lines.
messagelist--map-help--msg21=To build, click with left bracket.
messagelist--map-help--msg22=Add shift to place a ghost instead.
messagelist--map-help--msg23=You mine by holding x.
messagelist--map-help--msg24=To rotate items clockwise press r.  This rotates your hand or the selected entity, depending on whether your hand is empty.
messagelist--map-help--msg25=Add shift to rotate counterclockwise.
messagelist--map-help--msg26=h and v flip horizontally and vertically, respectively. A flip is not always the same as rotating by 180 degrees.
messagelist--map-help--msg27=You can get to a variety of UIs from this view.
messagelist--map-help--msg28=To get to your main inventory, crafting, research, etc. use e.  This is often called the main menu.
messagelist--map-help--msg29=To get to the fast travel menu, use alt v.
messagelist--map-help--msg30=To get to the world menu, for train alerts and other functions, use alt w.
messagelist--map-help--msg31=To get to the logistics interface for an item once you have unlocked bots, use control alt l.
messagelist--map-help--msg32=To open the UI for an entity, click it with left bracket.  Note that your hand sometimes must be empty to disambiguate between this and "fast replace", where for example a better chest will replace a worse one if you build over it.
messagelist--map-help--msg33=The mod supports a couple of lightweight features for orienting yourself.
messagelist--map-help--msg34=Use shift b to place a bookmark at the cursor and b to jump the cursor back to it.
messagelist--map-help--msg35=Rulers are a cross shape which play audio notifications whenever you cross one of the arms of the cross.
messagelist--map-help--msg36=To set a ruler, press control alt b.
messagelist--map-help--msg37=Once set, walk around and move your cursor to get a feel for how it works.
messagelist--map-help--msg38=To clear the ruler, use control shift b.
messagelist--map-help--msg39=Build lock is a feature which will place items behind you as your character runs.
messagelist--map-help--msg40=This is very useful to place things such as long lines of belts.
messagelist--map-help--msg41=Some entities have special build lock behavior.  The most important of these is belts, which will automatically face the way you are running.
messagelist--map-help--msg42=To enable build lock, press control b.
messagelist--map-help--msg43=Build lock disables if you bump into something, as the engine will move you off the line you intended to be on.
messagelist--map-help--msg44=Using build lock and rulers together is a fun way to quickly place long lines of belts and pipes.
messagelist--map-help--msg45=There are some important keys to get tools into your hand.  They are as follows.
messagelist--map-help--msg46=Use control c to get the copy tool.
messagelist--map-help--msg47=Use control x to get the cut tool.
messagelist--map-help--msg48=Use control v to get a temporary blueprint of whatever you last cut or copied.
messagelist--map-help--msg49=Use alt b to get an empty permanent blueprint.
messagelist--map-help--msg50=Use alt d to get a deconstruction planner.
messagelist--map-help--msg51=Use alt u to get an upgrade planner.
messagelist--map-help--msg52=Use control alt shift b to get a blueprint book.
messagelist--map-help--msg53=For controls related to driving, more advanced functions, and combat, please see the mod documentation on GitHub.
messagelist--map-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNdZRykvMTVWyUspNLNDNSM0pUKoFAJQxCas=

messagelist--menu-help--msg1=This is a menu.
messagelist--menu-help--msg2=It consists of some number of rows, sometimes with some items off to the right to control the main item.
messagelist--menu-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIy0lHKS8xNVbJSyk3NK9XNSM0pUKoFAJdfCew=

messagelist--research-menu-help--msg1=This is a category based interface exposing the ability to research technologies.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg2=Press k to find out what a technology does and what it needs to unlock.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg3=There are two kinds of technology.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg4=Normal technology is researched in a lab.  You put science packs in the lab, give it power, and the technology makes progress.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg5=A small number of technologies are instead triggered by performing in-game actions and unlock instantly once the requirement is met.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg6=Research which can be researched manually is done via the research queue.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg7=Click a research to add it to the back of the queue, and ctrl click it to add it to the front.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg8=You can get the progress of the currently researching research by pressing t from anywhere.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg9=Technologies in the researchable category are what you can research now.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg10=Locked technologies are technologies which depend on other technologies.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg11=Finally, the last category is what you have already researched.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg12=Please note that if a technology requires multiple science packs, all of the kinds of science pack it needs must be in a lab at the same time.  Otherwise the lab will not contribute to progress.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg13=For example, if a technology needs 100 automation and 100 logistic science, you must have 1 of each in a lab for the lab to progress, and the lab will handle 1% of the research before it needs more.
messagelist--research-menu-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNNZRykvMTVWyUipKLU5NLErO0M1NzSvVzUjNKVCqBQANLg2Y

messagelist--research-queue-help--msg1=This is the research queue.
messagelist--research-queue-help--msg2=Click technologies to cancel them.
messagelist--research-queue-help--msg3=Technologies at the top are first.
messagelist--research-queue-help--msg4=Due to API limitations, you can't drag technologies at this time.
messagelist--research-queue-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIy0VHKS8xNVbJSKkotTk0sSs7QLSxNLU3VzUjNKVCqBQAS2w3Y

messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg1=This is a spidertron remote, used to control one or more spidertrons.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg2=To add a spidertron to the remote, move your cursor to a tile with a spidertron and press right bracket. Press right bracket again on a linked spidertron to unlink it.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg3=To open a menu to select multiple spidertrons, press alt right bracket. This menu shows all spidertrons on the relevant surface in your force.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg4=To remove all spidertrons from the remote, press ctrl backspace.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg5=To add your cursor position to the autopilot queue for all spidertrons, press left bracket. This adds a waypoint to the existing queue.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg6=To clear the autopilot queue and set a new destination, press shift left bracket. This replaces all existing waypoints with the cursor position.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg7=To clear the autopilot queue without setting a new destination, press backspace.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg8=To cycle through spidertrons on the remote, use m and dot. Your cursor will move to each spidertron and read the tile information.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--msg9=Please note that after moving spidertrons, they often all end up on the same tile, so it may seem like this is not working. We hope to improve this in future.
messagelist--spidertron-remote-protohelp--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbKy1FHKS8xNVbJSKi7ITEktKinKz9MtSs3NL0nVLSjKL8nPSM0pUKoFAJiFEXU=

messagelist--trains-overview-help--msg1=This menu lists all trains.
messagelist--trains-overview-help--msg2=Each row shows a train with its name, position, and current state.
messagelist--trains-overview-help--msg3=To the right of each train are two controls: move cursor to the train, and toggle manual mode.
messagelist--trains-overview-help--msg4=Click a train to open its configuration menu.
messagelist--trains-overview-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIy0VHKS8xNVbJSKilKzMwr1s0vSy0qy0wt181IzSlQqgUAI5wObg==

messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg1=This menu displays warnings, to tell you about things that might be wrong.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg2=It is not necessarily the case that a warning means you need to do something about it.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg3=Advanced players tend to not lean on this menu so much later, because it can be quite a lot of information.  But the information here is very helpful while you are getting started.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg4=Warnings are sorted by distance from your cursor, and stop after 500 tiles.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg5=As an example of a false positive warning that you may encounter once you are an advanced player, it is sometimes perfectly fine if something is out of fuel.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIy1VHKS8xNVbJSKk8sysvMSy/WzU3NK9XNSM0pUKoFAAYCDYU=
