messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg1=This is a low-level equipment grid view.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg2=If you are just trying to equip things for the first time, you probably want the equipment overview tab.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg3=In Factorio, equipment goes into this grid and has dimensions. For example 1 by 1 or 2 by 4.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg4=The position of equipment relative to other equipment does not matter. For example, it is not necessary to put batteries near solar panels.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg5=But, you can only equip something if this grid has room.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg6=To add equipment to the grid in a specific location, click an empty position.  This will open a selector menu which you can use to grab equipment from your inventory.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg7=If this entity also has an inventory, that equipment shows up in the selector as well.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg8=Click equipment in the grid to remove it.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg9=If you remove and readd equipment to the grid, it will lose things such as how much energy it is holding.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg10=To reposition, you may use shift plus w, a, s, and d to drag things around, if there is enough empty space in the direction you want to move it.  This is limited by the game, not by the mod.  If you cannot move items around with the free space in the grid, you have to remove them and put them back.
messagelist--equipment-grid-help--msg11=Press backspace to order equipment removed from this grid.  The difference is that the equipment will be removed by bots, once you have unlocked them.

messagelist--general-ui-help--msg1=This is a UI.  All UIs in Factorio Access have similar controls.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg2=Press w, a, s, and d to move around.  Add ctrl to go as far as possible in the given direction.  For example ctrl w moves to the top of menus.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg3=To get out of all UIs, press e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg4=To find out what UI you are in, press shift e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg5=Sometimes you are in a nested UI, for example opening a menu inside a menu. To go back one level, press alt e.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg6=Press ctrl tab and ctrl shift tab to cycle between tabs.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg7=Press tab and shift tab to cycle between subtabs.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg8=If the difference between tabs and subtabs does not make sense, try playing with your main menu, opened by pressing e on the map.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg9=UIs come in many different shapes and sizes.  The three most common are grids, menus, and category-based views.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg10=When in a UI without an obvious shape, we will give you information on what you need to press.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg11=Generally, grids are grids, menus are vertical options sometimes with horizontal commands on a row, and category-based views are like grids but the rows are of different lengths depending on how big the category is.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg12=The reason this isn't simple is because being able to move sideways lets us group commands in rows with the thing they control, so that you don't have to arrow past all of them when you don't care about them.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg13=basic interaction is called clicking, and is done with left or right bracket plus modifiers.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg14=For example shift click is shift left bracket.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg15=To trigger buttons or otherwise perform the primary action, you click.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg16=Other menus sometimes use modifiers and right click, which are generally documented in their help text.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg17=You can search all menus.  To set your search pattern, press ctrl f, type what you want to search, and hit enter.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg18=To cycle through search results, use shift enter for next and ctrl shift enter for previous.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg19=A small number of menus support drag.  When dragging is supported, you drag by adding shift to the movement keys.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg20=An even smaller number of menus support typing alternate values. This comes up for example when dealing with circuit conditions.  To type a value, you press m.  Menus tell you when this will work.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg21=Finally, backspace and ctrl backspace are delete/clear keys.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg22=Backspace does safe clearing.  This means setting a value back to zero or flushing a fluid.  Clearing done with backspace is safe because it can be recovered from easily.
messagelist--general-ui-help--msg23=Ctrl backspace does dangerous delete.  This does things like permanently destroy blueprints!  Be careful.

messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg1=This is an inventory, a 10 by some number of rows grid.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg2=Inventories have some number of slots. When that is not a multiple of 10, the bottom row has some unusable cells.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg3=To take a stack to your hand, click it.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg4=Right click takes half a stack instead.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg5=k gives you more information on an item.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg6=To put an item into the inventory, click an empty slot with that item in hand.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg7=You can use shift click to move stacks to sibling inventories.  This does not work in the main menu, but does work when an entity is open.  Shift right click instead moves half.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg8=A sibling inventory is your inventory if you are in the entity, or the entity's main inventory if you are in yours.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg9=For example, this can be used to quickly move things to and from chests.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--msg10=As a reminder, your inventory is available as the last tab in an entity's tabs, if that entity uses inventories.
messagelist--inventory-grid-help--meta=eJyrVkrOL80rUbIyNNBRykvMTVWyUsrMK0vNK8kvqtRNL8pM0c1IzSlQqgUAHi8OJw==

messagelist--menu-help--msg1=This is a menu.

messagelist--research-menu-help--msg1=This is a category based interface exposing the ability to research technologies.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg2=Press k to find out what a technology does and what it needs to unlock.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg3=There are two kinds of technology.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg4=Normal technology is researched in a lab.  You put science packs in the lab, give it power, and the technology makes progress.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg5=A small number of technologies are instead triggered by performing in-game actions and unlock instantly once the requirement is met.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg6=Research which can be researched manually is done via the research queue.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg7=Click a research to add it to the back of the queue, and ctrl click it to add it to the front.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg8=You can get the progress of the currently researching research by pressing t from anywhere.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg9=Technologies in the researchable category are what you can research now.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg10=Locked technologies are technologies which depend on other technologies.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg11=Finally, the last category is what you have already researched.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg12=Please note that if a technology requires multiple science packs, all of the kinds of science pack it needs must be in a lab at the same time.  Otherwise the lab will not contribute to progress.
messagelist--research-menu-help--msg13=For example, if a technology needs 100 automation and 100 logistic science, you must have 1 of each in a lab for the lab to progress, and the lab will handle 1% of the research before it needs more.

messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg1=This menu displays warnings, to tell you about things that might be wrong.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg2=It is not necessarily the case that a warning means you need to do something about it.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg3=Advanced players tend to not lean on this menu so much later, because it can be quite a lot of information.  But the information here is very helpful while you are getting started.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg4=Warnings are sorted by distance from your cursor, and stop after 500 tiles.
messagelist--warnings-menu-help--msg5=As an example of a false positive warning that you may encounter once you are an advanced player, it is sometimes perfectly fine if something is out of fuel.
