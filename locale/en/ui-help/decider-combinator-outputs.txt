; Help for decider combinator outputs editing

The outputs tab lets you configure what signals the combinator outputs when conditions are met. Each output has a signal and either copies values from input or outputs a constant.

Press slash to add a new output.

Press m to select the output signal.

Press comma to set a constant value. This only works when not copying from input.

Press shift comma to toggle between copying from input and outputting a constant. When copying, you can press control comma to cycle which input networks to copy from.

Press backspace to remove an output. Focus will move to the previous output or the empty placeholder.

When no outputs exist, press slash to add the first one.
