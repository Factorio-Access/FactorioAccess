; Help for decider combinator outputs editing

The outputs tab lets you configure what signals the combinator outputs when conditions are met. Each output has a signal and either copies values from input or outputs a constant.

Press slash to add a new output.

Press m to select the output signal.

To output a constant: press dot to enter the constant value. This automatically sets the output to constant mode.

To copy from input: press control m to cycle which networks to copy from (red, green, or both). This automatically sets the output to copy mode.

Press backspace to remove an output. Focus will move to the previous output or the empty placeholder.

When no outputs exist, press slash to add the first one.
