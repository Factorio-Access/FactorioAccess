This menu displays warnings, to tell you about things that might be wrong.

It is not necessarily the case that a warning means you need to do something about it.

Advanced players tend to not lean on this menu so much later, because it can be quite a lot of information.  But the information here is very helpful while you are getting started.

Warnings are sorted by distance from your cursor, and stop after 500 tiles.

As an example of a false positive warning that you may encounter once you are an advanced player, it is sometimes perfectly fine if something is out of fuel.
