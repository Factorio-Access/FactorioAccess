This is a category based interface exposing the ability to research technologies.

Press k to find out what a technology does and what it needs to unlock.

There are two kinds of technology.

Normal technology is researched in a lab.  You put science packs in the lab, give it power, and the technology makes progress.

A small number of technologies are instead triggered by performing in-game actions and unlock instantly once the requirement is met.

Research which can be researched manually is done via the research queue.

Click a research to add it to the back of the queue, and ctrl click it to add it to the front.

You can get the progress of the currently researching research by pressing t from anywhere.


Technologies in the researchable category are what you can research now.

Locked technologies are technologies which depend on other technologies.

Finally, the last category is what you have already researched.

Please note that if a technology requires multiple science packs, all of the kinds of science pack it needs must be in a lab at the same time.  Otherwise the lab will not contribute to progress.

For example, if a technology needs 100 automation and 100 logistic science, you must have 1 of each in a lab for the lab to progress, and the lab will handle 1% of the research before it needs more.
