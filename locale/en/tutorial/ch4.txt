You now know enough to be dangerous, though not efficient, so it is time to begin moving faster and opening up the game to you.

You have accessed your inventory before.  Under that same UI are a bunch of others.  There are 3 mod UIs to concerrn yourself with, the main menu (e), the world menu(alt + w), and the mod configuration menu (control alt shift m).

The latter two do not matter for a very long time, and so we will not discuss them much in this tutorial.

Mod UIs are divided into a two level hierarchy.

The top-level hierarchy, tabs, are things like "inventories", "crafting", and "research".  You navigate between these with control tab and control shift tab.

One level below that are subtabs or controls, navigated with tab.  If you are in the inventories tab, this is every possible inventory for the building for example.

UIs also offer a help system, available with shift slash.  Close help with e, returning to the UI you were in.

There are two more important keys.  K, which gives you information on what is focused if such is available, and control + wasd, which moves as far as possible in a given direction. So for example, control w is top of menu.

We will discuss research first.  While crafting lets us fix your drill, research is how you know why it matters and what to aim for.

Open your main menu, then go over to the research tab.  This is composed of 3 rows one on top of the other: researchable, locked, and rpeviously researched.

Use w and s to switch rows, and a and d to explore the row.

Many of our UIs are like this, taking a not intuitive "shape" to make it so that you don't have to scroll through long menus.

Fortunately, every UI is searchable just like you searched your inventory earlier.

Right now you have two researchable researches, steam power and electronics.

Factorio has two kinds of research, research which you select and research which automatically unlocks.  Both currently available researches have an unlock condition instead of a science requireemtn.  To find out what it is, press k.

in this case, electronics is "craft copper plate x 10 of normal quality" and steam power is "craft iron plate x 10 of normal quality".

Quality is a space age thing.  All you need to know is that you won't ever find a quality better than normal in the base game, what you are playing now.

We now know what we need.  How do we get it?  Go back one tab to the crafting tab, then search for plate.

If you click either of the plate recipes, the game will tell you that you can't craft it!  That's because these must be done in a machine.

to find out what machines you can craft something in, press k.  This will also tell you what it needs as inggredients.

We can't easily filter the list down to machines you have right now for a variety of reasons, but if you check all of them you will find out in this case that the one you have is a stone furnace.

you started the game with one, but the reason that the stone from earlier in this tutorial is so useful is that you can now use it to make more.

But now it's time to circle back.  The last chapter of this tutorial said we would teach you how to fix your burner mining drill.

The punchline if you will is that stone furnaces require coal to function.  Coal and ore goes in and plates come out.

So, what we are actually going to do is this.  Use the scanner to find a tree, then let Kruise Kontrol mine a few for you.

This will give you wood.  You will never have a shortage of wood because very few things use it, so don't worry about running out.


Once you have some, you can craft a wooden chest.

Earlier, you found where the burner mining drill drops coal.  GO back there (you can find the drill with the scanner), and place the chest on that tile.

If the chest is in the right place and the drill has fuel, it will now begin to slowly fill the chest with coal.
