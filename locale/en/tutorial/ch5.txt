Now that you have buildings to manage, you need efficient ways to navigate between them. This chapter teaches you three ways to navigate the cursor: The bookmark for one quick reference point, fast travel points for multiple named locations, and cursor skipping to explore large areas quickly.

The first and simplest way is with bookmarks.  Pressing shift b sets a bookmark, and b returns the cursor to it.  You can put your cursor on the chest and hit shift b, for example.

You only get one bookmark, so the second option is the fast travel menu. Opened with alt v, the fast travel menu lets you create named fast travel points.

It consists of one row per point.  Each row has a number of commands.  Start by making a named travel point at your coal setup by putting your cursor where you want it and hitting create new, Typing a name, and hitting enter.

Then, explore the menu to see what is available.

The two most important items are teleport and move cursor, which are how you can monitor the drill.  Either teleport or move the cursor and use Kruise Kontrol when you need to get back to it.

The third thing you need to know now is cursor skipping.

Holding shift and using wasd moves your cursor up to 100 tiles in the given direction, stopping at the first change.

What counts as a change varies by situation, but it's usually what you would expect.

In this case, use cursor skipping on your coal patch to find out how big it is in general, and what the shape is.  It should be reasonably self-explanatory.

You will probably learn that it is much bigger than you thought.  Don't worry, it will be covered in drills soon enough.
