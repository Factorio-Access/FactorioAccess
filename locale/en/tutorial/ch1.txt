Welcome to the Factorio Access tutorial.  Before we get started, this chapter tells you a bit about what Factorio is, explains how to use the tutorial interface, and runs through a few basic checks.  To navigate through tutorial messages, press w and s.

before we continue, please note this is a tutorial.  It does not teach you everything the mod has to offer.  If you want to learn about topics intentionally left out here, please consult the reference documentation on the mod's GitHub readme.  The final chapters of the tutorial will give you a brief introduction to things we left out as well.

To get back here, use alt t.

To close the tutorial interface, press e. This puts you back in whatever UI you were in, and remembers your place for next time.

e opens your main menu if nothing else was open. If you hit e while the tutorial is closed, you will end up there. To get out of it again, press e a second time.

Most of the time, pressing e closes all open UI.  The tutorial UI is a special case.  Instead, e closes just the tutorial. This lets you read the tutorial while other menus are open without losing your place.

To save your game press f1.  Your game also saves automatically every couple of minutes, signalled by two clicks.

Finally, a markdown transcript of this tutorial is available in English in our GitHub.  You can also generate it with the console command /fa-tutorial-transcript.

Before you go further, it is important that we confirm that you have not enabled space age. If you have, you will need to recreate your save.

If you did not purchase space age, this does not apply to you.

If you did, please exit the game, go into the launcher's mod menu, and disable quality, elevated rails, and space age.

You may also want to enable peaceful mode, which stops enemies from attacking until you attack them first. You may wish to do that now as well, but that means remaking your save.

To do so, customize your save in the launcher's menu, go to enemies, and toggle it.  The Compass valley preset does this for you if you are using it.

The tutorial consists of chapters.  You move between chapters with control tab.  We call these tabs.

Each chapter has 2 subtabs.  You move between these with tab by itself.  They are the chapter's text and some example blueprints.  We will talk more about blueprints in a little while.

Game UIs are organized the same exact way.

Now, on to the game itself.

Factorio is a game about building a factory.  Your goal is to build up a base which can launch a rocket.

To do this, you need to build labs, and then put science packs in them to conduct research.

There are 7 kinds of science pack.  The first one you will encounter is automation science.  As the game progresses, you unlock more and have to get them all to the same place at the same time.  This is the main driving mechanic of Factorio.

Roughly, each science pack doubles the complexity of the game.  Getting through the first few is pretty easy, enough so that you can do it without building a factory if you're patient, but the last ones are a real challenge.

If you are ever lost, one way of figuring out what to do next is to see which of your technologies are the most expensive, or if you can research a new science pack.

Once you have researched most of the technologies in the game, you craft and launch a rocket.

Maybe that sounds easy.  But it's not.  And on top of all of that, you've got various kinds of enemies that really don't want you to be around!  If you aren't in peaceful mode, you also have to fight back.

Normally, you would get a very involved graphical tutorial and a lot of hints showing you how Wube wants you to play Factorio.  But we can't do that, so here is a brief explanation of how to think about it.

Factorio is a game about solving problems nested in other problems.

First, you learn how the basic pieces work.

then, you put the basic pieces together into small things, around 10 by 10 in size.  These use transport belts and inserters (robot arms) to make one kind of thing.

You then use those to make bigger pieces that put a few things together into a larger product.

As this continues, it becomes harder and harder to get everything into the same place or to move stuff around, so your scope continues to widen, and you unlock more tools to connect things over longer distances.

At the end of the game, science packs need to travel hundreds of tiles, and take hundreds of tiles to build as well.

The map is infinite for all practical purposes, and endgame bases are often hundreds of tiles on a side.

This has a few implications as to what makes a successful Factorio player, especially if you are blind.

Being organized is very important.  Working out repeating patterns that are easy to put together is also very important.  These tutorials will help you with learning some repeating patterns later.

The trick to doing really well is that if you are organized, you don't need to remember where you put hundreds of things.  Just that over here we make automation science, and that you solved it with a solution shaped like this.

When you go back to it, because you solved the problems on a small scale the same way, you can look at it and get it back into your head much more easily.

One of the things that makes Factorio a great game is that sighted players play the same way.  The game even has systems to let you save and quickly place down groups of buildings, called blueprints.  There is even a clipboard.

The reward isn't "look at how I placed 1000 things that work", though you can play it that way.  Instead, it's "look how I elegantly solved the problem Factorio confronted me with, and integrated it into the rest of my stuff".

Usually, a sighted player will start by being haphazard for their first run, throwing whatever they need at the time wherever.  Then, they learn to be more and more organized.  The difference is that as a blind player, being organized from the start matters more. Sighted players can fumble through disorganization because they can glance around and reorient. We can't, so this tutorial front-loads the "how to think about it" stuff.

As you get better at the game, your designs will tend to use more repeating patterns, but those repeating patterns will become complicated, and they will nest in larger things.

Now, it is time to move on to doing stuff for real.  Press control tab to move to the first real chapter, and we can get started on building our first lab.
