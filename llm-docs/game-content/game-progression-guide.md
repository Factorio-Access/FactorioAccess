# Factorio Game Progression Guide

This guide outlines the typical progression path through Factorio.

## Early Game (Manual Crafting)

### Starting Resources
- **Wood** - Obtained from trees
- **Stone** - Mined from stone patches
- **Coal** - Mined from coal patches
- **Iron ore** - Mined from iron ore patches
- **Copper ore** - Mined from copper ore patches

### First Tools and Machines
1. **Burner mining drill** - First automated mining
2. **Stone furnace** - Smelt ores into plates
3. **Burner inserter** - Move items between machines
4. **Wooden chest** - Store items

## Automation Phase

### Key Technologies
- **Automation** - Unlocks assembling machines
- **Logistics** - Better belts and inserters
- **Electronics** - Circuit production

### Production Chains
1. **Iron production:** Iron ore → Furnace → Iron plate
2. **Copper production:** Copper ore → Furnace → Copper plate
3. **Circuit production:** Copper plate + Iron plate → Electronic circuit

## Mid Game

### Power Generation
1. **Steam power:** Boiler + Steam engine
2. **Solar power:** Solar panels + Accumulators
3. **Nuclear power:** Nuclear reactor + Heat exchangers

### Advanced Production
- **Oil processing** - Crude oil → Petroleum/Heavy oil/Light oil
- **Advanced circuits** - Electronic circuits + Plastic + Copper cable
- **Processing units** - Advanced circuits + Electronic circuits + Sulfuric acid

## Late Game

### Rocket Launch
1. Build **Rocket silo**
2. Research **Rocket technology**
3. Craft **Rocket parts**
4. Launch **Satellite** for space science

### Infinite Research
After launching your first rocket, you unlock infinite research technologies:
- Mining productivity
- Worker robot speed
- Artillery range
- And more...
