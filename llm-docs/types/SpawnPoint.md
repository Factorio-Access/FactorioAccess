# SpawnPoint

The definition of a evolution and probability weights for a [spawnable unit](prototype:UnitSpawnDefinition) for a [EnemySpawnerPrototype](prototype:EnemySpawnerPrototype).

It can be specified as a table with named or numbered keys, but not a mix of both. If this is specified as a table with numbered keys then the first value is the evolution factor and the second is the spawn weight.
