# Color

Table of red, green, blue, and alpha float values between 0 and 1. Alternatively, values can be from 0-255, they are interpreted as such if at least one value is `> 1`.

Color allows the short-hand notation of passing an array of exactly 3 or 4 numbers. The array items are r, g, b and optionally a, in that order.

The game usually expects colors to be in pre-multiplied form (color channels are pre-multiplied by alpha).
