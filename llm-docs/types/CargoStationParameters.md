# CargoStationParameters

A cargo station is any entity that has the capacity to send cargo units. In Space Age those are [RocketSiloPrototype](prototype:RocketSiloPrototype), [SpacePlatformHubPrototype](prototype:SpacePlatformHubPrototype) and [CargoLandingPadPrototype](prototype:CargoLandingPadPrototype). [Cargo bays](prototype:CargoBayPrototype) may provide additional cargo hatches to cargo stations which are cargo bay connectable.
