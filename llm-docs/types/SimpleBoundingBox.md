# SimpleBoundingBox

An axis aligned bounding box.

SimpleBoundingBoxes are usually specified with the short-hand notation of passing an array of exactly 2 numbers. The first position is left_top, the second position is right_bottom.

Positive x goes towards east, positive y goes towards south. This means that the upper-left point is the least dimension in x and y, and lower-right is the greatest.
