# Sprite4Way

Sprites for the 4 major directions of the entity. If this is loaded as a single Sprite, it applies to all directions.

This struct is either loaded as `sheets` or `sheet` or a map of one sprite per direction. For per direction sprites, the sprites are loaded via `north`, `east`, `south` and `west`.
