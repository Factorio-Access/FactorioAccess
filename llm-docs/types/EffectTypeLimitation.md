# EffectTypeLimitation

A list of [module](prototype:ModulePrototype) effects, or just a single effect. Modules with other effects cannot be used on the machine. This means that both effects from modules and from surrounding beacons are restricted to the listed effects. If `allowed_effects` is an empty array, the machine cannot be affected by modules or beacons.
