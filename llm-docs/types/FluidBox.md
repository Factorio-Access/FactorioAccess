# FluidBox

Used to set the fluid amount an entity can hold, as well as the connection points for pipes leading into and out of the entity.

Entities can have multiple fluidboxes. These can be part of a [FluidEnergySource](prototype:FluidEnergySource), or be specified directly in the entity prototype.
