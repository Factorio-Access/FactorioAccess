# table

Tables are enclosed in curly brackets, like this `{}`.

Throughout the API docs, the terms "array" and "dictionary" are used. These are fundamentally just [Lua tables](http://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html), but have a limitation on which kind of table keys can be used. An array is a table that uses continuous integer keys starting at `1`, while a dictionary can use numeric or string keys in any order or combination.

**Type:** `builtin`
