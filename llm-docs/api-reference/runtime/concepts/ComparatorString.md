# ComparatorString

A string that specifies how the inputs should be compared.

While the API accepts both versions for `"less/greater than or equal to"` and `"not equal"`, it'll always return `"≥"`, `"≤"` or `"≠"` respectively when reading them back.

**Type:** `"="` | `">"` | `"<"` | `"≥"` | `">="` | `"≤"` | `"<="` | `"≠"` | `"!="`
