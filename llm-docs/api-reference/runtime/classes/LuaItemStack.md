# LuaItemStack

A reference to an item and count owned by some external entity.

In most instances this is a simple reference as in: it points at a specific slot in an inventory and not the item in the slot.

In the instance this references an item on a [LuaTransportLine](runtime:LuaTransportLine) the reference is only guaranteed to stay valid (and refer to the same item) as long as nothing changes the transport line.

Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
