# RealOrientation

The smooth orientation. It is a `float` in the range `[0, 1)` that covers a full circle, starting at the top and going clockwise.

This means a value of `0` indicates "north", a value of `0.5` indicates "south". For example then, a value of `0.625` would indicate "south-west", and a value of `0.875` would indicate "north-west".

**Type:** `float`
