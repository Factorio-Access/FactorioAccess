# RotatedAnimation

**Type:** `Struct`

## Properties

*These properties apply when the value is a struct/table.*

### layers

If this property is present, all RotatedAnimation definitions have to be placed as entries in the array, and they will all be loaded from there. `layers` may not be an empty table. Each definition in the array may also have the `layers` property.

If this property is present, all other properties, including those inherited from AnimationParameters, are ignored.
