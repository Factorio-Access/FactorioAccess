# SimulationDefinition

Used by tips and tricks and main menu simulations. Simulations can be controlled at runtime via [LuaSimulation](runtime:LuaSimulation).

**Type:** `Struct`

## Properties

*These properties apply when the value is a struct/table.*

### planet

**Type:** `SpaceLocationID`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "nauvis"

### game_view_settings

**Type:** `GameViewSettings`

**Optional:** Yes

### save

The save file that is used for this simulation. If not given and `generate_map` is `true`, a map is generated by the game.

**Type:** `FileName`

**Optional:** Yes

### init_file

This code is run as a (silent) console command inside the simulation when it is first initialized. Since this is run as a console command, the restrictions of console commands apply, e.g. `require` is not available, see [here](runtime:libraries).

**Type:** `FileName`

**Optional:** Yes

### init

Only loaded if `init_file` is not defined.

This code is run as a (silent) console command inside the simulation when it is first initialized. Since this is run as a console command, the restrictions of console commands apply, e.g. `require` is not available, see [here](runtime:libraries).

**Type:** `string`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** ""

### update_file

This code is run as a (silent) console command inside the simulation every time the simulation is updated. Since this is run as a console command, the restrictions of console commands apply, e.g. `require` is not available, see [here](runtime:libraries).

**Type:** `FileName`

**Optional:** Yes

### update

Only loaded if `update_file` is not defined.

This code is run as a (silent) console command inside the simulation every time the simulation is updated. Since this is run as a console command, the restrictions of console commands apply, e.g. `require` is not available, see [here](runtime:libraries).

**Type:** `string`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** ""

### mods

An array of mods whose runtime scripts will be loaded for this simulation, if they are present and enabled.

**Type:** Array[`string`]

**Optional:** Yes

### init_update_count

Amount of ticks that this simulation should run for before the simulation is shown to the player. These updates happen after init/init_file has been run and at the highest possible rate (> 60 UPS).

**Type:** `uint32`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 0

### length

How long this simulation takes. In the main menu simulations, another simulation will start after this simulation ends.

**Type:** `uint32`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 0

### generate_map

If `save` is not given and this is true, a map gets generated by the game for use in the simulation.

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** False

### checkboard

If this is true, the map of the simulation is set to be a lab-tile checkerboard in the area of `{{-20, -15},{20, 15}}` when the scenario is first initialized (before init/init_file run).

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** True

### hide_health_bars

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** True

### mute_technology_finished_sound

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** True

### mute_alert_sounds

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** True

### volume_modifier

Multiplier for the simulation volume set by the player in the sound settings.

**Type:** `float`

**Optional:** Yes

### override_volume

If true, overrides the simulation volume set by the player in the sound settings, simply setting the volume modifier to `1`.

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

### mute_wind_sounds

Overrides whether a simulation has its wind sounds muted.

Tips and Tricks simulations and Factoriopedia simulations have their wind sounds muted by default, other simulations don't.

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes

### hide_factoriopedia_gradient

**Type:** `boolean`

**Optional:** Yes
