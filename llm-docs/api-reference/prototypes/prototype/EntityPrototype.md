# EntityPrototype

Abstract base of all entities in the game. Entity is nearly everything that can be on the map (except tiles).

For in game script access to entity, take a look at [LuaEntity](runtime:LuaEntity).

**Parent:** [Prototype](Prototype.md)
**Abstract:** Yes

## Examples

```
{
  type = "container",
  name = "wooden-chest",
  icon = "__base__/graphics/icons/wooden-chest.png",
  flags = { "placeable-neutral", "player-creation" },
  minable = { mining_time = 1, result = "wooden-chest" },
  max_health = 100,
  corpse = "small-remnants",
  collision_box = { {-0.35, -0.35}, {0.35, 0.35} },
  fast_replaceable_group = "container",
  selection_box = { {-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5} },
  inventory_size = 16,
  open_sound = { filename = "__base__/sound/wooden-chest-open.ogg" },
  close_sound = { filename = "__base__/sound/wooden-chest-close.ogg" },
  picture =
  {
    filename = "__base__/graphics/entity/wooden-chest/wooden-chest.png",
    priority = "extra-high",
    width = 46,
    height = 33,
    shift = {0.25, 0.015625}
  }
}
```

## Properties

### icons

This will be used in the electric network statistics, editor building selection, and the bonus gui. Can't be an empty array.

Either this or `icon` is mandatory for entities that have at least one of these flags active: `"placeable-neutral"`, `"placeable-player`", `"placeable-enemy"`.

**Type:** Array[`IconData`]

**Optional:** Yes

### icon

Path to the icon file.

Either this or `icons` is mandatory for entities that have at least one of these flags active: `"placeable-neutral"`, `"placeable-player`", `"placeable-enemy"`.

Only loaded if `icons` is not defined.

**Type:** `FileName`

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
icon = "__base__/graphics/icons/wooden-chest.png"
```

### icon_size

The size of the square icon, in pixels. E.g. `32` for a 32px by 32px icon. Must be larger than `0`.

Only loaded if `icons` is not defined.

**Type:** `SpriteSizeType`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 64

### collision_box

Specification of the entity collision boundaries. Empty collision box means no collision and is used for smoke, projectiles, particles, explosions etc.

The `{0,0}` coordinate in the collision box will match the entity position. It should be near the center of the collision box, to keep correct entity drawing order. The bounding box must include the `{0,0}` coordinate.

Note, that for buildings, it is customary to leave 0.1 wide border between the edge of the tile and the edge of the building, this lets the player move between the building and electric poles/inserters etc.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

**Examples:**

```
collision_box = {{-0.4, -0.4}, {0.4, 0.4}}
```

### collision_mask

Defaults to the mask from [UtilityConstants::default_collision_masks](prototype:UtilityConstants::default_collision_masks) when indexed by the entity type.

**Type:** `CollisionMaskConnector`

**Optional:** Yes

### map_generator_bounding_box

Used instead of the collision box during map generation. Allows space entities differently during map generation, for example if the box is bigger, the entities will be placed farther apart.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "The value of collision_box."

### selection_box

Specification of the entity selection area. When empty the entity will have no selection area (and thus is not selectable).

The selection box is usually a little bit bigger than the collision box. For tileable entities (like buildings) it should match the tile size of the building.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

**Examples:**

```
selection_box = {{-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5}}
```

### drawing_box_vertical_extension

Specification of extra vertical space needed to see the whole entity in GUIs. This is used to calculate the correct zoom and positioning in the entity info gui, for example in the entity tooltip.

**Type:** `double`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 0.0

**Examples:**

```
drawing_box_vertical_extension = 0.5
```

### sticker_box

Used to set the area of the entity that can have stickers on it, currently only used for units to specify the area where the green slow down stickers can appear.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "The value of collision_box."

**Examples:**

```
sticker_box = {{-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5}}
```

### hit_visualization_box

Where beams should hit the entity. Useful if the bounding box only covers part of the entity (e.g. feet of the character) and beams only hitting there would look weird.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

### trigger_target_mask

Defaults to the mask from [UtilityConstants::default_trigger_target_mask_by_type](prototype:UtilityConstants::default_trigger_target_mask_by_type).

**Type:** `TriggerTargetMask`

**Optional:** Yes

### flags

**Type:** `EntityPrototypeFlags`

### minable

The item given to the player when they mine the entity and other properties relevant to mining this entity.

Internally forced to be `256` for [SpacePlatformHubPrototype](prototype:SpacePlatformHubPrototype).

**Type:** `uint8`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 1

### remove_decoratives

Whether this entity should remove decoratives that collide with it when this entity is built. When set to "automatic", if the entity type is considered [a building](runtime:LuaEntityPrototype::is_building) (e.g. an assembling machine or a wall) it will remove decoratives.

**Type:** `"automatic"` | `"true"` | `"false"`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "automatic"

### emissions_per_second

Amount of emissions created (positive number) or cleaned (negative number) every second by the entity. This is passive and currently used just for trees and fires.

This is simply a string, so any string can be used here. The entity that should be replaced simply has to use the same string here.

**Type:** `string`

### next_upgrade

Name of the entity that will be automatically selected as the upgrade of this entity when using the [upgrade planner](https://wiki.factorio.com/Upgrade_planner) without configuration.

The item count specified here can't be larger than the stack size of that item.

**Type:** `ItemToPlace` | Array[`ItemToPlace`]

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

**Type:** `EntityID` | Array[`EntityID`]

**Optional:** Yes

### additional_pastable_entities

Names of the entity prototypes this entity prototype can be pasted on to in addition to the standard supported types.

This is used to allow copying between types that aren't compatible on the C++ code side, by allowing mods to receive the [on_entity_settings_pasted](runtime:on_entity_settings_pasted) event for the given entity and do the setting pasting via script.

**Type:** Array[`EntityID`]

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
additional_pastable_entities = {"steel-chest", "iron-chest"}
```

### tile_width

Used to determine how the center of the entity should be positioned when building (unless the off-grid [flag](prototype:EntityPrototypeFlags) is specified).

When the tile width is odd, the center will be in the center of the tile, when it is even, the center is on the tile transition.

[Currently only renders](https://forums.factorio.com/100703) for [EntityWithHealthPrototype](prototype:EntityWithHealthPrototype) and [CorpsePrototype](prototype:CorpsePrototype).

**Type:** `WaterReflectionDefinition`

### ambient_sounds_group

**Type:** `EntityID`

**Type:** `IconDrawSpecification`

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
icon_draw_specification = {shift = {0, 0.5}, scale = 0.75, scale_for_many = 0.5, render_layer = "entity-info-icon"}
```

### icons_positioning

**Type:** Array[`IconSequencePositioning`]

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
icons_positioning =
{
  {inventory_index = defines.inventory.lab_modules, shift = {0, 0.9}},
  {inventory_index = defines.inventory.lab_input, shift = {0, 0.0}, max_icons_per_row = 6, separation_multiplier = 0.9}
}
```

### order

Used to order prototypes in inventory, recipes and GUIs. May not exceed a length of 200 characters.

The order string is taken from the items in `placeable_by` if they exist, or from an item that has its [place_result](prototype:ItemPrototype::place_result) set to this entity.

**Type:** `Order`

**Optional:** Yes

**Overrides parent:** Yes
