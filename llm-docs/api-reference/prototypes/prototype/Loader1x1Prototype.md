# Loader1x1Prototype

Continuously loads and unloads machines, as an alternative to inserters.

This loader type is identical to [Loader1x2Prototype](prototype:Loader1x2Prototype) with the exception of its hardcoded belt_distance. The belt_distance of the loader determines the distance between the position of this loader and the tile of the loader's belt target.

This loader type always has a belt_distance of 0, meaning by default it is 1 tile long in total. For a loader type with a belt_distance of 0.5, see [Loader1x2Prototype](prototype:Loader1x2Prototype).

**Parent:** [LoaderPrototype](LoaderPrototype.md)
**Type name:** `loader-1x1`
