# PropertyExpressionNames

All other MapGenSettings feed into named noise expressions, and therefore placement can be overridden by including the name of a property in this dictionary. The probability and richness functions for placing specific tiles, entities, and decoratives can be overridden by including an entry named `{tile|entity|decorative}:(prototype name):{probability|richness}`.
