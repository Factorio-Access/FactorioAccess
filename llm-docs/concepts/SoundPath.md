# SoundPath

It can be either the name of a [SoundPrototype](prototype:SoundPrototype) defined in the data stage, or a path in the form `"type/name"`. The latter option can be sorted into three categories.

The validity of a SoundPath can be verified at runtime using [LuaHelpers::is_valid_sound_path](runtime:LuaHelpers::is_valid_sound_path).
