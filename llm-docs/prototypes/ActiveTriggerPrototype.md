# ActiveTriggerPrototype

The abstract base of all active trigger prototypes. Active triggers are a special type of trigger delivery mechanism that function of a period of time and do not result in the creation or deletion of entities to function. They are intended to be short-lived objects associated with a surface and cannot be cancelled until they self-destruct. Active triggers support migrations and prototype changes, but require their own named prototype to function.
