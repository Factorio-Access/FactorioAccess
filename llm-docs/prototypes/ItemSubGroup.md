# ItemSubGroup

An item subgroup. Item subgroups are the rows in the recipe list in the player's inventory GUI. The subgroup of a prototype also determines its item [group](prototype:ItemGroup::group) (tab in the recipe list).

The built-in subgroups can be found [here](https://wiki.factorio.com/Data.raw#item-subgroup). See [ItemPrototype::subgroup](prototype:ItemPrototype::subgroup) for setting the subgroup of an item.
