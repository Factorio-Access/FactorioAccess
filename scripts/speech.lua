Speech System - Intelligently build and speak messages.

This module combines message building with speech output. Messages are built
using a fluent API and then sent to an external launcher process for
text-to-speech rendering.

We have a pattern in the mod especially around entity info, but also in lots of
other places.  Build a message with a prefix and then a list.  Then, possibly
append more prefix-list.  Right now we either do that with string concatenation
or we do it with manual use of spacecat and related FaUtils functionality.  This
is an alternative:

```
-- 'the thing with a, b, c"
return Speech.new()
    :fragment("the thing with")
    :list_item("a")
    :list_item("b")
    :list_item("c")
    :build()
```

The basic usage pattern is use `fragment()` to append text, `list_item()` to
signal that a list item has ended.  `list_item()` takes an optional fragment and
appends it, so you can just chain list_item to build long lists of one thing
each. Any two fragments appended one after the other are separated by space;
lists are separated by commas.

Unlike normal localised strings, you are not limited to 20 items. You are
limited to 20^20 items, which is also known as infinite for all practical
purposes.

Ok so: what's the point?  For those who don't already get why you'd want this,
it lets you have a series of functions that collaboratively build up a message.
Rather than trying to coordinate getting everything everywhere to agree on when
things are lists and whatnot, everything "at the bottom" gets to just use
fragment() and the piece one level up gets to coordinate the larger pattern of
separation.  Also in large functions the alternative is `table.insert` and a
join by hand.

This is very much not storage safe, and it is very much not intended to be;
attempts to do so throw when the game saves.
