## Description

The mod replaces the mouse with keyboard commands.  We call this the cursor.  This is the mod equivalent of the sighted cursor.

The Factorio world is continuous, but all buildings in Vanilla build on a tile grid.  The mod takes the continuous world and turns it into a tile grid for you.  You navigate this grid with WASD.

Walking always remains "smoothe", e.g. your character can be at `x = 1.2323`.  Most mod users do not walk much.

If you want to directly center your character on a tile, `shift + t` can be used to teleport. This works for long range teleports (a cheat) as well as short range "move me a couple tiles and line me up perfectly" teleports.

For those who wish to avoid teleporting long distances, place your cursor on an empty tile and press `ctrl + alt + right bracket` to trigger Kruise Kontrol.

The keys for the cursor are not logically arranged because of ergonomics.  By putting things on different hands, most operations are a "drum roll". For example, `d` `left bracket` over and over can build a line of stuff, and because it's both hands you can press it much, much faster.

You can think of brackets like the mouse buttons. They roughly match vanilla, and you will often see left bracket referred to as clicking on Discord and when discussing with other players.

### The Character

Your character is your body.  You always have one, unless you are dead or in other advanced situations that do not come up much in the base game.

You mostly do not need to be concerned with it, especially if you teleport, but it must be in range of building unless you place ghosts (10 tiles by default)

Your character is also what you "pick things up from". For example, putting your character on a belt and holding `f` picks up from that belt, approximately.  This is not precisely announced due to API limitations.

To remember this, your character is the thing with arms.  If you need your arms, then the position of the character matters.

For convenience, Factorio does not require you be close for everything, thus the larger building radius and the ability to place ghosts anywhere.

Unfortunately, however, API limitations mean that we cannot precisely announce when the problem is that you are out of range.  If you get an error bonk and can't figure out what else it could be, try moving closer.

The following sections elaborate on mod features.  Not all interactions are covered because many are very simple.  See the key list above for the full list.

### The Cursor and Hand

The cursor is where you are looking and operating.  As the cursor moves around, the entity you are operating on changes with it.  This is called selecting an entity.

The most basic use of the cursor is mining.  To do so, get your character within a few tiles of an entity like a resource and hold `x`.  This is also how you remove placed buildings.
Note that some entities take a while to mine.  An example of such is the rocket pieces in the initial crash site, all of which may be removed.

What the game calls the hand is not your character's hand, but your virtual hand.  Your hand's position is always at the cursor.

### Building

To build, you click with `left bracket` with something buildable in hand.  This will place the entity.  You are holding the top left corner.  It is important to note that the sighted build from the center.  This isn't keyboard friendly, so we changed it, but it sometimes matters when reading things or discussing with the sighted.

See the page on blueprints and blueprint books for more info on those special cases.

To place a ghost, add `shift`.  Ghosts are entities that mark where something will be built later, and can be placed at any range.  This is useful in the early game because Kruise Kontrol can build them for you; `ctrl + alt + right bracket` on a ghost starts building all ghosts.  In the late game, this is how you interact with construction robots.

For a few items, the mod adds special behavior:

- For underground belts, the underground belt will become an exit if it was going to match an entrance.
- For the offshore pump, which has weird placement rules, you can get a menu of proposed locations with `alt + left bracket`.

### Build Lock

Build lock is a system which lets you quickly place lines of stuff.  For example, you can run around and belts will put themselves down behind your character.  To trigger it, press `ctrl + b` with something buildable in hand.

For most buildings build lock places them as close together as possible, facing north.  But we offer a few special cases:

- For transport belts, the belts are set up to face the way you are moving, and will properly form corners
- For electric poles, each pole is placed the maximum distance from the last pole.

It is important to note that you are effectively running two build locks at the same time.  One is on the cursor, and one is on the character.  So for example if you move the cursor east while running west, you'll get a line of belts going east from where the cursor started and a second line going west from where the character started.  These are entirely independent.  best practice is to use only one or the other.

The cursor build lock is used by some players to place small numbers of entities close together.  By far the most useful is the version while walking.  You can place a long line of belts like this:

- Move the cursor to where you want it to start
- Press `shift + t` to teleport
- Put a belt in hand and turn build lock on
- Run your character in a straight line to where you want the belts to stop
- Empty the hand or turn build lock off with `ctrl + b`

### Bookmarks, the Ruler, and fast travel

The mod provides two closely related features: a cursor bookmark and a ruler.

The bookmark is a fast way to rememver one position on the map. You set it with `b` and move it with `shift + b`.

The ruler is like the bookmark but for alignment.  You place it with `ctrl + alt + b` and it forms an audio cross.  When your cursor or character crosses it, it plays a tone.  Clear it with `alt + shift + b`.

You can use rulers to quickly place large numbers of items.  For example, to place a belt going east, find where you want it to end, arrow a few tiles north, and place your ruler.  Then, you can turn build lock on and run in a straight line until your character hits the ruler, like hitting a wall.  IMPORTANT: build lock does not disable itself at the ruler, these are still separate features.

"multiple bookmarks" is fast travel, accessible with `alt + v`.  Fast travel is like your browser's bookmarks menu, but for map locations.


### Cursor Skipping

For larger distances, the mod offers cursor skipping.  Holding `shift` plus the cursor movement keys will move up to 100 tiles in any given direction, stopping at the first "change".  Change is somewhat ill-defined.  Examples which count include water to ground, belt corners, and rows of entities beginning or ending.

Many entities are larger than 1x1 and moving 3 tiles to place the next one is annoying.  For this reason we also offer skip by preview.  `ctrl + WASD` moves the cursor so that, if you built the item, it would form a perfect row or column.  For example an assembling machine is 3x3, so pressing `ctrl + d` would move you 3 tiles east. This also works on blueprints.

### Larger Cursors and Placing Tiles

Exploring the map one tile at a time is annoying, so the mod offers larger cursors.  Larger cursors are boxes, for example 3x3, 5x5, etc.  They perform two functions:

- As the larger cursor moves, a summary of everything in the box is announced.
- If building tiles such as landfill, clicking fills the entire cursor box with the tile (not a cheat--vanilla offers a similar function)

To change the size of your cursor, use `shift + i` to increase it and `ctrl + i` to decrease it.

In larger cursor mode, your cursor is at the center of the box and the box is always odd in dimension. So for example 3x3 is 1 tile in every direction from your cursor.

Two control changes happen when your cursor is larger than 1x1:

- `WASD` now moves by the size of the cursor instead of by 1 tile
- `ctrl + WASD` moves by 1 tile instead of performing skip by preview


### The Pipette tool

This is a vanilla function but deserves brief coverage.  Pressing `q` with an empty hand on a tile or entity puts "the most appropriate thing" in your hand.  For entities, this is the same entity if you have some in your inventory.  For tiles it depends: water, for example, is an offshore pump, and resources are drills.

It's not complicated at all, but it's important to know it exists


### Automation with Kruise Kontrol

Kruise Kontrol is a mod that we forked which provides some automation functions.  It is useful because it can make up for not being able to use the mouse.

Place your cursor on a tile or item and press `ctrl + alt + right bracket` to trigger it.  Pressing `enter` cancels.

What happens depends on what the cursor is on:

- If an empty tile, you walk to it
- If a resource, rock, or tree, you mine it
- If a ghost, you build it, crafting as needed
- If an item marked for upgrade or deconstruction, you upgrade or deconstruct
- If on something that takes fuel, you refuel it
- If on an enemy, you fight it.

Kruise Kontrol supports vehicles, and can thus be used to easily drive places.

It will continue the current action until there is nothing else to act on close by.  Triggering on a ghost for example will build all ghosts until it can't find any ghosts or can't find the items to build it.
