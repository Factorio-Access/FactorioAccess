---

## Modified Features List

### Features That Exist But Work Differently Than README

#### 1. Coordinates Input
**README**: ALT + T: Type in cursor coordinates
**ACTUAL**: CONTROL + ALT + T (fa-ca-t)

- README: Line 208, 357
- Code: control.lua line 2411
- Key: fa-ca-t in data/input.lua line 230

**Impact**: Minor - users need different key combination

---

#### 2. Repeat Last Phrase
**README**: CONTROL + TAB: Repeat last spoken phrase
**ACTUAL**: CONTROL + TAB now used for UI section navigation

- README: Line 126
- Code: control.lua line 2758 comment says "now handled by the UI router for section navigation"
- Key: fa-c-tab repurposed

**Impact**: Major - repeat functionality gone, replaced with UI navigation

---

#### 3. Shooting/Combat
**README**: C: Shoot at it
**ACTUAL**: Combat removed; old implementation used SPACEBAR

- README: Line 246, 531
- Code: fa-space (SPACEBAR) was combat key, not C
- Status: Now removed entirely

**Impact**: Documentation inaccurate even for 1.1 version

---

#### 4. Remote View
**README**: ALT + I: Toggle remote view
**ACTUAL**: Disabled in Factorio 2.0

- README: Line 339
- Code: control.lua lines 2579-2585 has comment "remote view is currently not working in Factorio 2.0"
- Key: fa-a-i exists but doesn't function

**Impact**: Feature non-functional, pending Factorio API fix

---

#### 5. Blueprint Flip
**README**: G: Flip blueprint vertical
**ACTUAL**: Remapped to V

- README: Line 485
- Code: control.lua line 3569 redirects to V key
- Conflict: G used for health check

**Impact**: Key changed to avoid conflict

---

#### 6. Stack Transfer Modifiers
**README**: CONTROL + LEFT/RIGHT BRACKET for smart insert
**ACTUAL**: Now CONTROL + SHIFT + LEFT/RIGHT BRACKET in inventory UI

- README: Lines 432-434
- Code: scripts/ui/inventory-grid.lua lines 283-366
- Modifier: Added SHIFT to avoid conflict

**Impact**: Different key combination for inventory transfers

---

#### 7. Walking Mode Toggle
**README**: ALT + W to toggle between 3 modes
**ACTUAL**: Only 2 modes work (Telestep, Smooth-Walking)

- README: Lines 185-193
- Code: MIGRATION-2.0.md line 44 says "only Telestep and smooth walking modes working"
- Key: fa-a-w keybinding exists but handler removed

**Impact**: Step-By-Walk mode not accessible

---

#### 8. Vehicle Honk
**README**: V: Honk horn (ground vehicles), V: Open Fast Travel Menu
**ACTUAL**: V conflicts - resolved context-dependently

- README: Lines 559, 824
- Code: control.lua line 3569 handles both contexts
- Context: V is fast travel when not in vehicle, honk when driving

**Impact**: None - works correctly but README doesn't explain context

---

#### 8. Unknown/Undocumented Keys

These keys exist but their purpose is unclear or undocumented:

**CONTROL + ALT + N**: Unknown function
- Key: fa-ca-n in data/input.lua line 363-366
- Code: No handler found in control.lua
- Status: May be unused or legacy

**CONTROL + ALT + SHIFT + D**: Unknown function
- Key: fa-cas-d in data/input.lua line 470-473
- Code: No handler found in control.lua
- Status: May be unused or legacy

**SHIFT + U**: Unknown function

- Status: Special consumption mode suggests important function

**Investigation needed**: Check if these are placeholders or have hidden functionality

---

## Key Binding Discrepancies

### Keys With Conflicts or Ambiguities

#### 1. CONTROL + B Duplicate Definition
**Issue**: Defined twice with same key sequence

- Definition 1: "toggle-build-lock" (line 846-849)
- Definition 2: "fa-c-b" (line 860-863)
- Impact: Unclear which takes precedence
- **Fix needed**: Remove duplicate or use different name

---

#### 2. X Key Overloaded
**Issue**: Used for both mining and zoom controls

- fa-x: Mine (linked to game control "mine")
- fa-zoom-out: X (linked to "zoom-out")
- fa-zoom-in: X (linked to "zoom-in")
- fa-debug-reset-zoom-2x: X
- fa-debug-reset-zoom: X

**Impact**: Multiple handlers for same key
**Resolution**: Likely context-dependent (cursor vs zoom mode)
**README**: Documents X as mine only (line 244)

---

#### 3. G Key Context Conflict
**Issue**: Used for health check and blueprint flip

- README Line 139: G: Check character health and shield
- README Line 485: G: Flip blueprint vertical
- Actual: G remapped to V for blueprints (control.lua:3569)

**Impact**: Conflict resolved in code but README wrong
**Fix needed**: Update README to show V for blueprint flip

---

#### 4. V Key Multi-Purpose
**Issue**: Different functions in different contexts

- README Line 559: V: Open Fast Travel Menu
- README Line 824: V: Honk horn (when driving vehicle)
- Actual: Context-dependent routing in control.lua:3569

**Impact**: Works correctly but not explained in README
**Fix needed**: Document context-dependent behavior

---

#### 5. ALT + L Ambiguity
**Issue**: Two separate keybindings for ALT+L

- fa-a-l: ALT + L (line 1128-1131)
- fa-ca-l: CONTROL + ALT + L (line 1114-1117)

**Impact**: fa-a-l is pause/unpause logistics (control.lua:4218)
**Resolution**: Both valid, different functions
**README**: Only documents multi-modifier versions (lines 860-863)
**Fix needed**: Add ALT+L to README logistics section

---

#### 6. SPACEBAR Overloaded
**Issue**: Multiple definitions for SPACEBAR

- fa-space: SPACEBAR (linked to "shoot-enemy")
- fa-c-space: CONTROL + SPACE

**README Documentation**:
- Line 533: SPACEBAR for fire at enemies (REMOVED)
- Line 635: SPACEBAR for rocket silo launch
- Line 836: SPACEBAR for vehicle weapon fire

**Actual**: SPACEBAR contexts in control.lua:4118-4131 (rocket silo)
**Impact**: Combat removed, so only silo/vehicle use remains
**Fix needed**: Update README to remove combat, clarify contexts

## Files Requiring External Review

Some features mentioned in README may be **outside the mod codebase** (game reconfigurations):

1. **Factorio settings modifications** - Settings.lua exists but may have external config
2. **Launcher configuration** - Launcher repo separate from mod
3. **Screen reader configurations** - External to mod (JAWS/NVDA setup)
4. **External mod integrations**:
   - Pavement Driving Assist (PDA) - For cruise control and driving assistant
   - Kruise Kontrol Updated - For automated pathfinding/building
   - Other optional mods mentioned in wiki

**These are NOT documented in this analysis** as they're outside the mod's control.lua and scripts/.
