# Control.lua Refactoring Update

## Issue Discovered: Duplicate Module

During the refactoring session, we discovered that `item-info.lua` and `item-descriptions.lua` were duplicates:

- **item-info.lua** (original): Already existed and was actively used via keybindings `fa-y` and `fa-s-y`
- **item-descriptions.lua** (created during refactoring): Was created without realizing the functionality already existed

## Resolution

1. **Kept the better implementation**: We replaced `item-info.lua` with `item-descriptions.lua` because it had:
   - Better code organization with helper functions
   - More modular structure
   - Better documentation
   - Cleaner separation of concerns

2. **Updated the interface**: Modified `item-descriptions.lua` to match the expected event-based interface:
   - Added `read_item_info(event)` wrapper
   - Added `read_last_indexed_item_info(event)` wrapper
   - Kept internal functions for better modularity

3. **Fixed naming inconsistency**: Also fixed the `alert-manager` â†’ `audio-cues` renaming that was incomplete from the previous session

## Current State

- All 26 tests passing
- Code properly formatted
- No duplicate modules
- Consistent naming conventions

## Lesson Learned

Always check for existing functionality before creating new modules! The naming confusion (item-info vs item-descriptions) made it easy to miss that this functionality already existed.
